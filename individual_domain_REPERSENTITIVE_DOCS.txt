{52: ['When it comes to buzzwords used by businesses,   has got to be at the top of the most-used list. Thanks to the internet and all of the ways technology is changing, analytics and   have never been more important. And while data is great, it\'s what’s done with it that can make or break a company. That’s where business analytics comes in. When used correctly, BA can be leveraged to accurately predict future events that are related to the actions of consumers, market trends, and also assist in creating more efficient processes that could lead to an increase in revenue. Business analytics has many use cases, but when it comes to commercial organizations, BA is typically used to: While these are the most common use cases, there are four primary methods of business analysis. They’re implemented in stages, starting with the simplest. One method isn’t more important than another, it all depends on what your end-goal is when using BA.\xa0 When you use these  , your data can be cleaned, dissected, and absorbed in a way that makes it possible to create solutions for no matter what challenges your organization may face. Deciding which method to go with will depend on the business situation at hand. \xa0 Now that we’ve narrowed down how it works, let’s now break down all of the components that go into business analytics and which methods it uses to find its valuable conclusions. The method you decide to go with when taking a deep dive into BA is going to depend on the end-goal you set before starting the process. Whichever method you choose, you are sure to find actionable insights waiting for you at the finish line.\xa0 Data mining is the strategy of sifting through massive datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and other truths about data that aren’t initially visible using machine learning, statistics, and database systems. There are several   that business analytics can pull from, including regression, clustering, and outlier detection. This is a useful element of business analytics as it leads to faster and more efficient decision making. For example, through data mining, a business may be able to see which customers are buying specific products at certain times of the year. This data can then be used to segment those customers.\xa0 Text mining is the process of extracting high-quality information from the text on apps and throughout the World Wide Web. Companies use text mining to collect textual information from social media sites, blog comments, and even  . Then, this data is used to improve customer service and experience, develop new products, and review the performance of their competitors. The process of data aggregation consists of gathering and collecting the data, which is then presented in a summarized format. Essentially, before it can be analyzed, it needs to be collected, centralized, cleaned, and then filtered to remove any inaccuracies or redundancies.\xa0 This is a crucial step for business analytics because the accuracy in which you can gather insights from data is directly related to the kind of relevant and actionable results you’ll have at the conclusion of the process.\xa0 An example of data aggregation would be how a marketing team uses data like customer demographics and metrics (age, location, number of transactions, etc.) to personalize their messaging and offers. When business analytics are used to analyze processes that occurred during a specific period or season, businesses are provided with a forecast of future events or behaviors, thanks to historical data. Forecasting can be used for several different things, such as retail sales around specific holidays and spikes in specific internet searches around certain events - like an award show or the Super Bowl. Jackie Jeffers, Analytics Strategist at  , stresses the importance of using forecasting as a major part of your strategy. "Forecasting based on historical data is useful for setting\xa0 yearly goals and predicting online user behavior, such as traffic and conversions. Customer journey analytics allow you to identify first-touch interactions with a potential lead, all the way to the conversion step. Having visibility to all touch-points in the nurture process lets you optimize the steps in between and improve the user journey." Not only does business analytics help build your lead funnel, but it impacts your bottom line in other ways. Forecasting call volume, for example, can help optimize staffing resources in a call center.\xa0Having the ability to gather and analyze data is not only beneficial but critical to making data-driven and informed decisions." For all you visual learners out there,   is an absolute must-have part of business analytics. It seamlessly takes the information and insights drawn from your data and presents it in an interactive graph or chart.\xa0\xa0 The right   is crucial to this process to help track business metrics and KPIs in real-time so you can better understand performance and goals.

There are a lot of moving parts that go into business analytics, but it may be unclear why BA is important to your organization in the first place. For starters, business analytics is the tool your company needs to make accurate decisions. These decisions are likely to impact your entire organization as they help you to improve profitability, increase market share, and provide a greater return to potential shareholders. There’s no denying that so many businesses are impacted by technology, but when used correctly, BA has the chance to impact your company for the better as it provides a competitive advantage to a variety of companies. While some companies are unsure what to do with large amounts of data, business analytics works to combine this data with actionable insights to improve the decisions you make as a company. Plus, since this data can be presented using any format, the decision-maker at your organization will feel informed in a way that works for them and the goals you set at the beginning of the process. Essentially, the four main ways business analytics is important, no matter the industry, are: Business analytics have use cases in a wide array of industries and organizations. As technology becomes more advanced, more and more companies are developing new ways to utilize big data to their advantage to maximize their profits and improve the customer experience.\xa0 For instance, let’s say you run a fast-food restaurant. You may use business analytics to speed up the ordering process for your customers using the drive-thru. When you use BA to monitor the traffic that the drive-thru receives, you’ll be able to know your peak hours and when to increase efficiency. When you know the line is about to get long, you can move around your staff to get more employees working the drive-thru lane, or even have them recommend orders that can be completed quickly. When lines are shorter, employees can recommend items with higher margins that are more expensive and take more time to create.\xa0 The popular meal kit delivery service, Blue Apron, used business analytics to   for their orders and recipes. Each week they sent its subscribers a mixed menu of meals for purchase, and thanks to predictive analytics, they were able to use various data insights to avoid product spoilage and fulfill orders. To do this, Blue Apron looked at customer-related insights that consisted of historical data of how often a customer made specific orders. There was also recipe-related data that focused on a customer’s preference for recipes in the past. Finally, they looked at seasonal trends to see if there were purchasing patterns of higher or lower order rates for a specific time of year.\xa0 Thanks to predictive analytics, Blue Apron was able to better understand their customers, improve the user experience, predict shifting preferences, and even identify how tastes in meals change overtime.\xa0 The  \'s CEO,  No matter the size of your business or the industry in which it operates within, business analytics provides a variety of benefits. One of the main benefits is that it allows your business to plan for the unexpected. BA can model the trends in an organization’s sales, profits, and other key metrics while projecting them for the future. This allows businesses to see changes that may occur annually, seasonally, or on any scale, which provides a chance to prepare and plan ahead. Perhaps you’ll need to decrease spending to prepare for a slow season, or invest in new marketing campaigns. BA can make it easy for larger companies to predict order volume and minimize waste.\xa0 Business analytics also allows your organization to test new marketing campaigns. Since BA provides you with data surrounding customer behavior, you can better understand the effectiveness of your advertising campaigns on different audiences and demographics. Also, when you’re able to identify that the customer is less likely to return, you can consider offering targeted promotions to gain their business back. When you utilize BA to your advantage, you’ll have a competitive edge over the competition -- no matter your industry.\xa0 Business analytics has some potential pitfalls that you’ll need to overcome.\xa0 For starters, you’ll find the most success with it when all parties within your company fully support its adoption and execution. It’s always going to need buy-in from senior leadership and a clear corporate strategy. Getting everyone in upper management to sign off on a BA strategy can be difficult, so be sure to present business analytics as supportive of strategies already in place. This should also include clear and measurable goals to help those who are slow to be convinced by the benefits of BA. In addition to executive ownership, business analytics also require IT involvement, meaning the right technology infrastructure and tools in place to handle the data. Business and IT teams must work together for business analytics to truly succeed. While you’re at it, make sure you have the right project management software in place to implement predictive models and adopt an agile approach. During the initial months of an analytics project, it’s important to remain committed to the end result. While the cost of analytics software may be high, and ROI isn’t immediate, stay dedicated. The analytical models will develop over-time and predictions will only improve. A business that isn’t able to make it through the investment period will likely abandon the entire concept.\xa0 Once your analytics are presented, you’ll also need end-user buy-in. End-users need to be involved in adopting business analytics and have a stake in the predictive model that was developed. With that comes top-notch change management, as your organization should be prepared for the changes that these insights will bring to current business and technology operations. A career in business analytics is a popular choice among those who enjoy working with numbers. To start working towards a career in BA, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree in business analytics, data science, information management, business intelligence, marketing, statistics, or a related field. \xa0Some of the more popular career paths related to business analytics are: If you need a place to start within the business analytics industry, one of the more common paths is the role of a data analyst. There’s no denying that this job is in high-demand, especially when you consider\xa0 that every organization is beginning to see the value a data analyst will add to their staff.\xa0 If you’re going this route, you may be wondering if you live in a city that pays the most to become one. Here are the top five paying cities: In order to have a career in one of the roles listed above, you’ll need a specific skill set to succeed.\xa0 It’s not uncommon that   (BI) is often confused for business analytics, and vice versa, as the two are similar. BI also deals with historical data, but this data tends to be compiled from various places, like a company’s CRM software, ERP systems, and marketing automation tools. With both BA and BI, data is collected, sorted through, and displayed using data visualization software so that business executives can have a visual representation of any spikes or pain points that may be uncovered.\xa0 However, there is one main difference between the two: Business intelligence is more concerned with   a company’s performance and where it stands on key metrics. It provides context to   happened in the past,   it may have happened, and   is happening now. Business analytics takes the context provided by business intelligence and applies statistical analysis, data mining, predictive modeling, and other techniques. These methods are more advanced, and they’ll provide   – also known as forecasting. It can be tricky to determine which method is right for your business. Use business intelligence if: On the other hand, use business analytics if: Like business intelligence, sometimes it’s unclear how business analytics differs from data science. Both involve gathering data, modeling, and obtaining various insights. The difference between the two stems from BA being specific to business-related problems, like cost and profit, and can predict what could happen in the future. Data science is the larger or superset of the two, as its main focus is to answer questions related to customer preferences, seasonal factors, and geography within the business. It combines data with algorithm building and technology to answer these questions.\xa0 In short, data science is the science of studying data using statistics, algorithms, and technology. BA is the statistical study of business data.\xa0 Let’s consider a real-life example. Let’s say you open up an ice cream store. You buy all of the necessary ingredients and equipment, and even come up with a catchy name. Business analytics will help you answer questions like: Data science can help you answer questions like: Implementing the right business analytics strategy isn’t something a company can do overnight. However, when specific best practices are put into place, you can be sure that the insights you receive allow your business to be as successful as possible. These best practices include: When you take the time to do these four practices, you can be sure that your business will benefit the most from data-driven decision making. When your organization chooses to use business analytics, you are bound to make better decisions regarding revenue, customer experience, and overall efficiency. These methods are often considered a hidden gem as they can reveal ways to get an edge over your competitors. Set your goal, keep your eye on the prize, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what you find.\xa0 ', 'These are just a few scenarios of how businesses can utilize business intelligence tools to help improve supply chain management by leveraging data. Many factors feed into a supply chain and each one creates unique data that can be molded into insights. Keep in mind, though, that business intelligence tools will not do the work independently. Users will need the efforts of data scientists and analysts to shape the raw data into actionable insights. Business intelligence solutions provide the first step into improving supply chain management. ', "Behind any successful company are the career-changing decisions that helped make them great. But have you ever wondered how those decisions are made? The glitz and glamour of entrepreneurship has warped many public narratives about success. Some CEOs would like you to believe that their gut is the most important decision-making tool they have. The truth is that few big decisions get made at any company without good ol’ fashioned  . While one might assume that business intelligence has been entirely automated, you might be surprised to learn that there are real people behind all business intelligence analysis. Who are these human computers calling the shots on a company’s biggest decisions? They’re called business intelligence analysts. Business intelligence analysts help company’s make sense of the massive amounts of data they have on hand. They review this data to help companies streamline processes, increase profits, and follow industry trends to keep themselves on the cutting edge.

This isn’t the sort of business faux-pas that you can apologize for any move on from. Companies are being fined millions of dollars for exposing customer data. The role of a business intelligence analyst is just as much about protecting data as it is collecting and reviewing it. Educating your fellow employees on best practices for handling sensitive information and working closely with the   department to protect user data are crucial elements of the role. All the customer data in the world means nothing if you don’t know how to use it. Aside from just digging into the raw numbers, your role as a business intelligence analyst will include interpreting the results.

We’ve already covered many of the hard skills you’ll need for a role in business intelligence, but there’s more to it than that. To  , you’ll need to be able to communicate your findings with management. That makes the role of a business intelligence analyst a delicate balance between research skills and communication skills.

"], 22: ["Being in the right place at the right time is crucial when it comes to job hunting—but how can we know when to apply to increase the chance of getting hired?\xa0 First of all, we need to understand how the recruitment cycle works. The recruitment cycle is simply a schedule defining when a company starts looking for new employees, and when they aren’t looking to hire. Recruiting managers use recruitment cycles to guide their  , and savvy applicants who pay attention to these cycles can use them to know when to apply—but there is more to it than just following a cycle. The question “when it is the best time to  ?” cannot be answered universally—there is no definitive best time to apply. However, recruitment trends and job searching tips can offer insight. In this article, we’ll go over how companies typically run their recruitment cycles each season, then offer some advice on how to be prepared when the time comes to apply. Winter is a great time for  , but not for applying to jobs. Avoid applying during winter since companies use this time to rebalance their budgets as the year comes to an end. Companies tend to spend winter focusing on other things they need to accomplish before another fiscal year ends.\xa0 Also, during December many HR departments and recruiting staff face budget limitations, so they may not have the resources to hire new employees. These factors, plus the holiday vacations many employees take during this time of year, means that companies do not offer many jobs in the colder months—unless it is an emergency. In the spring, the hiring process is more robust than it is in the winter, so you can expect more opportunities. Spring is the time when students are nearing the end of the school year, so companies are eager to grab the best soon-to-be graduates, offering them training and jobs for positions that are hard to fill.\xa0 As early as January or February, companies start looking for new talent that could contribute to the company in the year ahead. Therefore, you can expect to see a wider range of job offers. As the new fiscal year begins in January, accountants and financial managers are in high demand. Also, as winter ends, the construction, tourism, and hospitality industries start to bloom, which means more open positions. The summer is a convenient time to start a new job, especially a  . Schools, museums, amusement parks, country clubs, and arcades are also packed with the job vacancies in the summertime, so it’s the best time to apply for such jobs. Still, this does not mean you cannot get a job in the IT sector during the summer—it’s just that some jobs are more frequently available during this time of year. At the same time, summer is prime time for travel and leisure, especially when it comes to office-bound fields such as IT, so expect that many recruiting managers will be out of office for some time. If you are looking for a teaching job, keep in mind that the school job searches start in summer, when class is not in session. There is no huge demand for job applicants in autumn, but many companies use this season to focus on filling out remaining positions if there are any. It’s the time of year when employees come back from summer holidays and starting to get reacclimated to their jobs. All companies are equipped and geared up for the winter and they do not typically think of hiring new people to join their already-formed teams.\xa0 However, if some positions are not filled due to a lack of applicants or because there were previously no good candidates, you can expect to see job vacancies. If you’re lucky, you may happen to be one of the workers that a company needs to hire before the final quarter of the year begins. In order to apply at the right time, you need to stay updated on companies, news,\xa0 and recruiting processes. This means more than just having a CV or resume at the ready—you must also know which companies are looking to hire. Stay informed by reading about your industry and you will know when recruiting season is at its peak. There are several places to look for news and many things worth knowing—follow these guidelines to increase your chances of getting hired. Recruitment cycles are specific to each industry, so you should find out the best time to apply for a job in your industry specifically.\xa0 For example, January is the perfect time to apply to finance jobs, as companies usually need reinforcement to keep the company's financial goals and objectives up to date in the new year. You can expect to see a lot of job offers in finance departments from the beginning of January to the end of April. The summertime (from June to September) is a great time to apply for jobs at schools and universities. As the school year ends, schools want to secure professors or teachers for all subjects. If an employee quits, a school will look to replace them with the new candidate over the summer. Summer is also great for overseas jobs.   look for and prepare candidates in the summer so they are ready for autumn when most overseas job contracts start. As someone who is looking for a job, you need to keep up with the latest news and trends to know when you should apply. For example, if you read that there is a huge real estate construction demand, it is natural to expect that the industry will need to hire a lot of workers. You would not know that if you had not been following the news and trends. So, keep up with the latest trends to ensure that you are aware of job demand in your industry. You can also ask people that work in specific industries about the recruitment process at their job. For example, let’s say you want to work in the auto industry and you have a friend who works at Mercedes-Benz. That friend may know the most appropriate time for job applications as they know how things work and flow at their company and similar companies. So, it might not be a bad idea to speak to a friend about the best time to apply for a job if they work in an industry you want to get into. Of course, no one can give you the exact time or details, but guidance can mean a lot. Companies hire workers as they grow and require more people to operate. Reading the news and industry-related magazines is the best way to ensure that you are well-informed about future job openings. The hiring process starts as soon as a company decides that it needs more skilled workers, so their recruiting efforts may begin even without any official press release or job posting. If you’ve been keeping up with industry news know when to apply ahead of the pack. These days, businesses use modern methods to communicate with the public—many companies and enterprises announce job openings via social media channels. Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are the perfect sources of job information, so be active on these social media platforms and you’ll be the first to hear about job postings. Make sure you routinely scroll all the latest news on the feed of the company that you want to work for in order not to miss any job ads. Thanks to social media, we know what is going on in any given company. Social media is practically a requirement in order to be a transparent company. The majority of companies use social media to let people know about their work and progress, so as soon as you notice that a company announced the expansion of their team, you can expect new job vacancies to be opened. As you learned earlier, summertime is the perfect time for some specific jobs, like hospitality and school jobs. However, if you aren’t looking for a job in these industries, you can prepare yourself for future job application opportunities. Applying to jobs even during hiring downtime\xa0makes you more prepared and ready for the hight of the hiring season. Although the majority of jobs are not typically available during this time, you may still find a decent selection of opportunities. However, it is very likely that you will not get a call back about your application until autumn, as many hiring managers are on holiday during the summer. It is not called summer vacation for anything, isn’t it? Timing is important in many facets of life, from sports to comedy, but in your job search it is especially important. Good or bad timing can make or break your chance at your dream job, so make sure you’ve done your research and are ready to apply at the right time for your industry.\xa0 ", 'The shift to a candidate-driven market is the most extensive and significant development in recruitment.\xa0 For the first time, more positions are available than applicants, empowering candidates to apply. With so many employers desperately looking for the same talent and skills, recruiters and talent acquisition specialists work harder to differentiate and attract top talent and build a  .\xa0 In this highly competitive market,   is the most critical recruiting skill to find and hire the best candidates. Candidate sourcing is one of the key steps to identify exceptional talent for future or existing positions that match your desired skills, education, and interests. It includes searching for both active and passive candidates. Whether it\'s local or  , an exceptional candidate experience can go a long way when finding talent for your organization. Candidate sourcing is a proactive tactic to ensure potential candidates are not missed. This helps build a strong talent pipeline and long-lasting relationships.\xa0 Many recent developments have altered global recruitment and international employment as we know it. Recruiters face different challenges when sourcing candidates. It\'s a strange mix of new complexities, high unemployment, talent shortages, and high churn rates.  have difficulty finding suitable candidates. Meanwhile, employers in nearly every US state are expected to experience substantial  .\xa0 Additionally, the skills required for most professions have changed dramatically. The global   is predicted to be around 58%. Workers will experience a 42% shift in essential workplace abilities in 2022.\xa0 This shift in skills availability needs the global workforce to become lifelong learners. The key to constructive and proactive change management is holistic workforce planning, reskilling, and upskilling. With these trends already in play, tactical challenges like poorly written job descriptions and poor candidate experience can fuel the fire. Uncertain, ambiguous, or perplexing requirements make it difficult to find extraordinary talent. This may adversely impact your brand image. Furthermore, experienced applicants may be hesitant to apply for a poorly described position. All this hurts your talent pipeline. As candidate sourcing accompanies many challenges, knowing   before diving into how sourcing works is essential.\xa0 Sourcers discover and qualify new prospects, whereas recruiters manage the process from the moment a candidate is interested or qualified until hiring. If your team is large enough, don\'t have them all do the same thing. Instead, let the sourcers handle one end of the recruiting pipeline while the recruiters work on the other. Simply put, talent sourcing aims to transform non-applicants into applicants. On the other hand, recruitment necessitates converting applicants. Talent sourcing is the first step in the hiring process and a critical component in developing a strong talent pipeline.\xa0 Building a sourcing strategy helps you fill open vacancies faster and expands your talent pool. Other advantages of developing a sourcing strategy include repurposing completed sourcing and recruitment efforts, cultivating relationships that lead to a better  , and establishing an internal recruiting and sourcing pipeline. The key to a successful candidate sourcing strategy is tightening your team\'s focus and efforts to ensure quality. Start with a thorough understanding of your company\'s strategic goals. In other words, consider the positions currently open and future growth or changes that may affect your hiring needs. It\'s good to consider "what if?" scenarios. This may be the most challenging phase in creating your talent pipeline since it necessitates substantial brainstorming and cross-departmental debate. The next logical step is researching your broad demographic and issuing reports that can help cover the available talent pool (even passive candidates). Additionally, establishing a competency framework can empower sourcing and recruitment professionals to take more innovative steps and make better decisions impacting your business\' bottom line. Encourage your recruiters and sourcers to keep their eyes out for new applicants who fit your candidate personas and  . Train them, keeping your future employment plans in mind. Build your sourcing pipeline effectively and efficiently to attract top talent. You can use different candidate sourcing techniques for this.\xa0 Running creative campaigns can help capture a candidate’s attention and increase brand awareness. When more people know about your brand, more applicants come in, and you find the best talent.\xa0 While organizations can use various messaging platforms, they shouldn’t overspread their message. A little research can go a long way. Consider employment sites, forums, and industry events specific to your business to send the right message to candidates. Direct sourcing means finding potential applicants by creating a pool of freelancers and contingent or temporary talent instead of a third party like a recruiter.\xa0 Connecting directly with the market helps you hire contingent workers for quick project work or even full-time employees.\xa0 Indirect talent sourcing uses recruitment firms to source candidates. This entails paying external companies upfront to find the candidates and a fee later when you finish hiring. While this may help keep your payroll low, it eventually costs time and money. Recruiters and hiring managers want to find exceptional prospects as soon as possible. In an ideal world, their partnership is seamless and productive. Open communication is crucial to source candidates. To create the best hiring environment, the hiring manager and recruiter need to discuss job requirements, what works and what doesn’t, major issues, expectations, and more to make their jobs easier. Identifying and addressing the hiring managers\' needs can help recruiters make good hiring decisions. Your brand encompasses every touchpoint with candidates, from the first message to the exit interview. A strong employer brand is estimated to   and cost per hire by 50%. Therefore, building your brand can help you level the playing field.\xa0 Because your brand serves as the strategic foundation for your recruitment messaging, it\'s essential to take the time to comprehend and build it properly. Your brand statement should reflect what you stand for so that it resonates with current and potential employees alike.\xa0 Employers can increase brand awareness by including their staff in their stories, encouraging them to personalize their LinkedIn accounts, starting a company blog, engaging in the press, and speaking at conferences. Being present on job boards, social platforms, and forums can help amplify the brand message and exposure. You can provide just enough material and engagement to capture their interest and get them to respond to your outreach messaging. Creating talent personas for each position helps you know exactly what you’re looking for in a candidate before the hiring process begins. Knowing who you\'re looking for lets you figure out where to find them.\xa0 Identifying gaps in your organization and developing candidate profiles to actively seek people with fresh ideas, experiences, and personalities is a wonderful way to implement diversity hiring programs. Because the job description is one of a candidate\'s first points of contact with your company, it\'s important to write job descriptions that reflect your target candidate’s profile. This enables candidates to better understand what a company expects from them and determine whether they’re suitable for the position. The advantages of a good candidate database are undeniable. Candidates from an existing database are a recruiter\'s most reliable source of placements. Recruiters need to work at peak efficiency to generate job opportunities in today\'s competitive job market. A well-maintained database allows them to communicate more effectively, spend less time on non-value-added tasks, and focus more on building connections. Once you\'ve determined your company\'s database needs, you\'re in a good position to find more candidates in less time or seek alternative sources for your search. Employers benefit from a diverse global workforce. As the world becomes more global, candidates look for employers offering the possibility to work worldwide. Expanding your talent pool can increase your chances of finding the ideal candidate and staying ahead of the competition. However, sourcing international candidates comes with many compliance challenges.\xa0 Employers should know the labor laws in different countries to build a new office or enter a new market. A good way to do this is to partner with a third-party recruitment outsourcing company to ensure everything in your recruitment process is compliant. Further complexities arise after the actual recruitment. You can work with an   where your partner takes care of managing payroll, paying international employees compliantly, or offering comprehensive and consistent benefits based on local country laws. This reduces the hassle of being present in the country where you want to hire or employ staff. Using social media to attract and convert talent has been one of the significant developments in recruiting in recent years. Social recruiting is more than just posting current vacancies on your company\'s social media pages. When it comes to candidate sourcing, you can use social media to find suitable applicants early, build a relationship with them, and encourage them to apply. There is no better way to find passive candidates than job boards and social media. You get many recommendations since everyone is on social media. Social media is more powerful than any other candidate sourcing tool, given the number of people using it. Every medium has its challenges, and in social recruiting, content must compete for users\' limited attention, and messaging must be engaging and straightforward to attract potential candidates effectively. There are many ways you can expand your reach to find candidates online. Job boards are a great way for candidates to research opportunities available in their field. Recruiting employees from job boards while creating unique job descriptions sets you apart from your competition and increases your brand awareness in the industry.\xa0 Another great way is to partner with your recruiter network to find leads. These recruitment firms already have a large talent pool of active and passive candidates. Recruiters and sources can leverage a virtual hiring event to connect and communicate with multiple candidates at a specific date and time, all from one online platform.\xa0Compared to traditional methods of screening and interviewing, virtual recruitment events allow companies to increase their candidate reach while saving time. Passive candidates make up a significant portion of the global workforce. Despite recent changes in the job market that have increased the number of job seekers, the best talent is often already in excellent and stable positions in most industries. This suggests that they may not be actively looking for a job but may be open to new options. Referrals are an ideal approach to finding such people. Employee referrals give you instant access to talent as it’s sourced through your employees\' connections. This saves time in the hiring process that would otherwise be spent on sourcing, testing, coordination, and negotiation. Finding and recruiting candidates not currently looking for a job is called passive candidate sourcing.

And while there are brains out there that excel in converting words into pictures, others struggle. As those brains sit and take a stab at it, they think, “Why can’t they   paint me a picture?” Although not always painted, visual   can save the day when that picture gives us the help we need to better understand information. Want details on a specific type of visual communication? Skip ahead to: Pictures aren’t just for children’s books anymore. While all other   provide information, visual communication does it in a creative way that is appealing to the eye. While businesses typically rely on more formal methods of sending and receiving information, such as verbal or written communication, there is still a need for visual aids in the workplace. Most of the time, visual communication will accompany another type of communication. Think of it as the sidekick\xa0to the various\xa0 . There are multiple kinds of visual communication in business, and each one is best paired with a certain type of information. A graph is a type of visual communication that represents numerical data. When presented using only  , numbers aren’t the most thrilling topic. The more you simply list them, the more that information is going right over your audience’s heads. In business, graphs are most commonly used to help communicate number-heavy information because it is easier to pull meaning from a visual aid than from a series of spoken numbers. Let’s look at an example of a graph saving the day. Say you are meeting with your boss to discuss the increased progress of you and your team, with which you are extremely proud. This information can be presented in two ways: with or without a graph. Without a graph, you can simply tell your boss that over the last year your team has increased productivity by 58 percent. As impressive as this number may be, the dull delivery leaves your boss resting on a number and without much reaction. With a graph, you can tell your boss about your team’s productivity, but also   them the month over month breakdown. The visual aid moves the conversation from listing numbers to showing a story of the progress, increasing the comprehension and interest of the viewer. Take a second look at the information you are about to deliver. If you are finding it has an overwhelming amount of numbers, it might be wise to include a visual aid for your audience. While photographs can act as personal mementos, they also have a place in visual communication in business. Words can only do so much to explain a person, place or thing, so pairing descriptive words with an image always does better in providing the full effect. Let’s look at an example of a photograph doing the descriptive work for you. Say you are in charge of on-boarding new team members. The company you work for has a humble beginning, and you are doing your best to highlight the progress it has made. You describe it as best you can, but they don’t seem to grasp the intensity of it. To help them understand, you pull up a photo of the crummy basement where the business originated. The new hires compare the basement pictured to the glamorous office they are currently sitting in and begin to understand the company’s success and appreciate its modest origin. Some things are harder to describe than others. Recognize the times when accompanying a message with a photograph is your best bet. Models provide examples of how something should ideally look. If you have ever provided someone with an example of a final product, you are providing them with a visual aid in the form of a model. In business, models are especially useful when training someone to complete a task they have never done before. Directions are helpful, but examples will provide more detail about the format and execution of the final product. In a detail-oriented workplace, models are the key to making sure every part of a project is included and consistent. An object might not seem like a form of visual communication, but it is something that people need to look at to understand it. In business, providing a visual aid in the form of a physical object is especially important when your business sells a product. Whether they are personally selling it or not, all employees should know the product their company is selling inside and out. You can do your best to describe it to them, but it is best for them to physically hold it. As they tamper, they may discover things about the product that would be of interest to a customer that they otherwise wouldn’t have noticed. Whether it be describing an existing product to a new employee, or a new product to an existing employee, providing the object being sold can increase their understanding. Visual communication elements provide the message receiver with another way to go about understanding information. Most people are lying when they say they don’t mind staring at a piece of paper full of text. Give the audience what they really want: visuals. ', 'Yellow. Imagine how many times a designer and printer have to go back and forth until the yellow that the printer produced was the exact yellow in the designer’s mind. We have a seemingly endless amount of colors to choose from and a simultaneously limited vocabulary to describe them. This problem is tough for everyone, especially graphic designers. If a client points to the sun and says “that’s the color yellow I want my   to be”, it’s hard to be sure you perceive that color in the same way. It’s like saying something is heavy; how heavy do you really mean? Thank goodness for scales. And thank goodness for Pantone. Before Pantone, every printing company had their own color guide; “yellow” was printed differently depending on how each individual ink company interpreted that color to look. Some yellows were darker than others; some were more orange and some were more green. And it was never exactly what the designer had in mind. In 1963, Pantone (meaning “all colors”, combining   and   developed the first color matching system. Thanks to this system, graphic designers can see exactly what “yellow” would look like on paper and provide the printer with the Pantone number to make sure that they got what they wanted. For the first time, color consistency existed for designers, printers, ink makers, and their clients. If the client chooses “yellow”, the designer can pass that choice on to the printer who orders that exact ink color, prints with that color, and provides a final product that matches the client’s needs. This isn’t just great news for creatives looking to please their clients with one-off projects. Brands can also finally have color consistency across all of their marketing materials from blimps to billboards, no matter what agency or freelancer they work with, no matter where in the world they’re located. Talk about a miracle. Pantone is now used universally and recognized as the world’s authority on color. The Pantone Matching System (PMS) is the color standardization system that assists in color matching and identification. It is comprised of 1,867 solid colors. The majority of the colors for graphics are assigned a three or four-digit identification number followed by the letters U, C, or M. These letters represent paper stocks “uncoated”, “coated”, or “matte”, respectively. With these variations, designers and users can see what their chosen color would look like on each of these different kinds of papers. Some colors don’t look different at all when placed on different kinds of papers, while others look worlds apart from one another. If you’re using a Pantone color, make sure that you specify which version you’d like to be printed by including the appropriate letter. The Pantone Matching System is comprised of 1,867 colors that are created by combining 13 base pigments. All of these colors can be found on Pantone’s   or in their printed book, which is a more reliable (and more expensive) visual resource. When a company decides on their desired color(s), they can send their logo or asset designs to a printer, along with the primary Pantone number to ensure that their materials are being printed in the exact color they want. Style guides are one of the best ways to make sure that employees in the same company are using the same elements consistently throughout their marketing materials and website.\xa0Pantone numbers can be included in a brand’s  so that employees of the company who want to design additional materials can use the accurate colors to remain consistent with the original designs.\xa0 Printing with Pantone can get expensive but it’s often worth it, especially for big brands who can’t afford inconsistency. We already have a color system for printing: CMYK. Why do we need another system? CMYK uses four plates (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to print out the desired color. CMYK color mode is what traditional, in-home printers use to print a wide range of colors. However, the desired color has a chance of coming out a little differently each time it prints, depending on the calibration of the printer. For example, the green you intended to print may come up a little lighter than expected on some occasions. If one copy of a document is being printed, this inconsistency doesn’t make much of a difference. But for a brand printing 10,000 business cards for their employees, “close enough” won’t cut it. Pantone provides designers with security. Pantone doesn’t combine any colors during the printing process; it   the color being used in the process. It’s much more pure than CMYK, and the difference is noticeable. Pantone base inks are carefully mixed first to create the intended color, then put onto one plate to be printed on a special machine that has to be prepped for each job. Calibration no longer becomes a problem because there are no other plates to calibrate with. Pantone printing is best for large projects with consistent, pure colors while CMYK printing is better for a mixture of different printing jobs. If your brand doesn’t have a custom color, are they really a brand? Probably. But some brands have really taken it to the next level and hired Pantone to make their own custom color. The price ranges depending on the request,\xa0but that doesn’t mean companies don’t cash in to make their brands pop. Even Jay-Z has his own Pantone color: a shade of blue with a top-secret name. But not all brands keep their Pantones classified. Pantone’s Color of the Year has taken place for 20 years. To select a color, Pantone’s experts look for influences among different mediums, from fashion and art to socio-economic conditions and new technology. This year’s color? PANTONE 16-1546 Living Coral. You can read more about Living Coral on Pantone’s   page. With over one thousand pure colors to choose from, Pantone provides the world with the type of consistency that designers once only dreamt of. Pantone is like a promise: the color you choose in the beginning is the color you get in the end.

From paperless offices to remote work culture, employees use technology at work in all kinds of ways to optimize their output. Why can’t the same be true in the classroom?  (LMS) is an effective way to take advantage of this digital moment and think about education in the same frame as we do business. How can we use the current technological tools available to us to effectively manage a classroom? We’ll take a look at how LMS training can change the way an educational system functions, from students to teachers to administrators.\xa0\xa0 Why should teachers, students, and administrators alike all go through training for learning management system software? The answer is simple. It can fundamentally change the way education works for the better. Here are six ways LMS training can improve classroom performance: LMS training can enhance the tools at your disposal for having students work together to accomplish your curriculum’s goals. Using an LMS solution, students can create their own profiles and collaborate with each other on assignments, projects, and other aspects of the curriculum.\xa0 Learning management systems have built-in structures for collaborative learning, and which substantially simplifies the process of.\xa0 Along with collaborative learning tools comes the ability to incentivize students to complete their work in unique ways that turn the concept of traditional homework on its head. Gamification in learning management system software, including leaderboards, streaks, and rewards for students complying with the expectations set out by the class and system, provides a new angle of incentives.\xa0 We see on rewards for customer or user loyalty on many tech platforms today. Learning management system software takes this popular concept and applies it to the classroom. Being trained in how to use LMS software can help any educator set incentivized goals for their students that align with the greater educational goals in the class.\xa0 From the first day of class to throughout the year, there’s a high likelihood that students will be at different levels of proficiency. This is where learning how to use learning management systems can benefit your ability to effectively reach every student where they are in their ability to learn.\xa0 Personalized coursework is an LMS software feature that takes the time out of faculty and administrators evaluating each student individually and prescribing the perfect coursework. LMS software automatically is able to evaluate students’ levels of proficiency in different topics and find the perfect fit for them in terms of assignment difficulty and strenuousness. Being trained in how to use LMS software can ensure a student is being individually catered to.\xa0 One of the most practical features of LMS software is grade tracking. When managing a large classroom and tracking grades throughout the year, an educator needs an automated, computerized system to act as a database that is accessible and intuitive to use. While many teachers historically have turned to spreadsheet software, learning management system software is built specifically with grade tracking in mind. Being able to track students’ progress throughout the year is essential for an educator, and this feature of learning management system software is ample reason on its own for all educational professionals to be trained in how to use a learning management system. Missing a lesson or whole day of school becomes less of a burden on students and teachers alike with LMS software. “E-days” and other types of substitutes for physical presence in class are unique features of LMS software that make up for a student or teacher falling behind by not being present in class. LMS training eases the burden of missing lessons or assignments by bringing the classroom right to the device of students. LMS software also includes a calendar feature for scheduling lessons and assignments in advance. Instead of using a separate calendar tool, learning management system software integrates assignments and classwork with a calendar directly on the platform. Lessons and homework can be planned weeks in advance, and students can always have a source to make sure they are up to date. Now that you’re up to speed on all that learning management system software can offer, it’s time to start training to use the many facets of LMS software that can benefit your educational environment.

Using technology in the classroom turns a static, one-way lecture into a dynamic, engaging experience for all students. Some classroom management tools turn lessons into interactive games, giving students different types of encouragement for keeping on track in class. The common theme between classroom management tools is the teacher’s ability to directly encourage active learning in students, and allowing different modes of learning to take place. Many classroom management tools are optimized for district-wide implementation, though plans are available for teachers and individual schools as well. The development of classroom management software has changed the way teachers interact with classrooms. Hard copies of grade books can be a thing of the past for educators that find the right classroom management tool. Additionally, student communication with teachers has never been easier with quick, one-on-one messaging capabilities.\xa0 Are you looking for a better way to actively engage students in your lessons? Are you   that will house all of your assignments in one place? Perhaps you’re looking for something with premade lessons to present to classes.

', 'Technology has transformed the way we interact, and EdTech is no exception.\xa0 Educational technology, also known as EdTech, is no stranger. It grew faster than anyone could imagine and became a worldwide phenomenon within a few years. What started as a novelty or luxury is now a household name, heard and used by billions of people around the world.\xa0 Gone are the days when students and teachers resorted to traditional chalkboard teaching and learning methods. EdTech has broadened the horizon, giving users the ability to engage in new and innovative ways while bridging the gap between academic and social learning. EdTech is short for education technology. It employs IT tools to enrich education and enhance learning.\xa0Student management systems,  , educational podcasts, video conferencing software, and social media learning tools all fall under the broad umbrella of EdTech. Almost two decades ago, EdTech wasn\'t what it is today. Its rapid development has completely changed the learner and teacher dynamic globally. Before EdTech became popular, students physically attended school in a classroom with physical books and were tutored by a physically present teacher. Some institutions still prefer the “physically present” aspect of education and choose hybrid learning over   for professional development.\xa0 EdTech’s growth is quickly shifting focus from classroom-based learning to online learning. Mobile devices, laptops, and tablets have made virtual learning much more effortless. All you need to do now is go online and enjoy a feature-rich learning experience. And who doesn\'t want that? EdTech simplifies complex work and makes everyday tasks interesting. Teachers no longer have to manually grade hundreds of test papers, enroll students in institutions, and laboriously sort assignments through disjointed systems. EdTech takes care of this and many other tasks through automated grading tools.\xa0 Some might say that classrooms haven\'t changed. Modern students just experience them a little differently.\xa0 Learning from home is now more synonymous with working from home. Both are driving a surge in EdTech usage around the world. In fact, the global EdTech and smart Classroom size reached around   at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.34%, increasing to $241.58 billion by 2026. As global circumstances magnify EdTech, many see and reap its benefits. EdTech helps deliver education globally, reducing travel and other learning-related costs while bridging the geographic divide. Teachers, learners, and institutions benefit financially and save significant time with   that simplifies internal and external processes. While many are happy about the cost savings, EdTech preserves the environment as more institutions adopt e-learning and upload course content online. Additionally, technologies such as cell phones and the internet are affordable and accessible\xa0on the wallet. Billions of people around the world depend on them for their daily activities. And this dependency is paving the way for accessible and good\xa0e-learning. Although online education doesn’t have a fixed target audience, the younger generations are generally more inclined to accept online learning. Gen Z, for example, grew up in a technology-driven world and developed a strong fondness for it. Personalized, flexible, and affordable education with diverse learning tools and platforms is more of an expectation than a luxury. This has resulted in EdTech rising through the ranks and making education accessible to all. EdTech will continue to accelerate as companies seek to use technology to bridge the gap created by unprecedented events. This new shift in focus is toward becoming more agile and functioning optimally without interference. As technology becomes key to business operations, there will be more needs and better governance, and   and EdTech will only grow in the future. Education involves the transmission and preservation of knowledge from one individual to another. EdTech impacts the entire educational transaction from start to finish. Not only does it affect or enhance learning, but it also solves many pain points for teachers and institutions alike.\xa0 EdTech is evolving into a necessity. It offers flexible educational solutions that bridge the global divide while being cost-effective, which further strengthens its reach and liking. EdTech is education available through technology. As long as someone has a device and a working internet connection, they can use EdTech. While many institutions turn to learning management and student management systems to deliver training and improve their back-end processes’ efficiency, students turn to EdTech for online training and assessments. Users can pay for   and systems or access paid self-learning platforms. Demographics are not a constraint for EdTech. EdTech offers many tools and systems to help education providers deliver the right learning experience. Below are some common EdTech systems. Learning management systems have developed rapidly following e-learning\'s advent and have become widespread and accepted by institutions and students worldwide. These systems include software applications for tracking, grading, managing, and delivering online educational courses. Many education providers struggle to maintain quality standards and  due to manual processes. As many of these organizations adopt and adapt to the new norm of working from home (WFH), interactions, assignments, student enrollments, and the like are more difficult to oversee and manage through Excel spreadsheets and multiple systems. Using a student management system brings these processes into one easy-to-use application, allowing staff to focus on high-value tasks.  are doing the rounds and becoming a significant EdTech resource. They help conduct meetings and deliver lectures or courses as they host remote and hybrid work or school environments. EdTech entails different learning styles and guided methodology for remote learning. Let\'s take a look at some top EdTech trends transforming education. Virtual educational experiences are at their peak, leading to a global surge in online education. As institutions and students recognize and enjoy the EdTech benefits, they move closer to a virtual learning experience. Simply put, virtual education is a learning environment where teachers deliver coursework through various course management applications over the internet and other multimedia resources. Virtual experiences connect students and teachers separated in time and space as everything is done online and conveniently in each individual\'s chosen environment. While effective, classroom learning has taken a step backward. As virtual experiences skyrocket, EdTech is on its way to even greater innovation. Virtual experiences have fueled several microtrends, including video-based learning, microlearning, and  , to name a few. Video-based learning is learning something new by watching a video online. This can be done anywhere, anytime, and is a big part of virtual experiences. In your lifetime, you\'ve probably subscribed to a channel, signed up for a class, or watched a random video on social media that taught you something. This is extremely popular in online and virtual learning. The amount of information we’re exposed to daily increases as technology develops. In fact, we absorb   as much information today as we did in 1986. The ever-increasing amount of content consumed over the internet reduces the attention span for each content type. EdTech companies now deliver content to audiences online in bite-sized portions. Students don\'t need to commit to lengthy sessions, as short-term, focused sessions are more effective and popular. Social learning involves using social media to learn. It has peaked in recent years, especially when working from home is the norm. Because humans are social creatures and social media is a way of connecting people, it plays an essential role in our lives. Universities and companies in various industries see this as a gold mine and seize the opportunity to use social media for better learning experiences. \xa0have been around for a long time, and millions of organizations use them worldwide. The need to manage customer interactions, build relationships, streamline processes, and increase profitability is timeless, which means CRMs will always be a trending tool.\xa0 Many institutions fail to realize that generic CRMs aren’t the only option available. CRM customization is slowly evolving, providing institutions with numerous benefits, including comprehensive virtual learning features and tools. Institutions can   to meet their expectations and needs when looking for industry-specific CRMs. EdTech trends and tools have laid the groundwork for innovation, prompting many companies to adopt this technology and see success. Let\'s look at some examples of successful EdTech campaigns and how they\'re transforming education. Gamification involves adding game-like mechanics to a non-gaming environment, such as a learning management system, a student management system, an education app, a website, and so on.   is a global phenomenon and highly\xa0effective in EdTech. The global educational gamification market reached   and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 29% between 2021 and 2027. , a cloud-based writing assistant that checks spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement, and delivery errors, leverages gamification through a "Freemium" approach. It allows users to access some features for free, but users need to subscribe and pay for monthly or yearly subscriptions to unlock all other features. Free trial online learning often enables this model to give learners a taste of what is to come. If they like the first lesson, registering and paying for the course would naturally be the next step. Gamification also offers awards, which is a good way to motivate users. For example, at the end of an online course, just like learners would receive a physical star for good work, virtual awards in the form of certificates, stars, or similar are given to keep them engaged and motivated. There is no escaping  , not even in education. In addition to providing each student with a personalized learning experience based on preferences, AI has evolved rapidly over the years, simplifying different scoring activities like grading.\xa0 Gone are the days when teachers manually graded hundreds or even thousands of test and exam papers. AI \u200bcapabilities allow auto-grading to score multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank type questions automatically. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Automated grading is a tool built into learning management systems that many institutions use to enable instructors to grade exams, tests, and assignments quickly and automatically, leaving no room for human error. This is a   where grading is a necessity. The system is coded to learn the responses and recognize if an answer is right or wrong. This useful, time-saving, and accuracy-enhancing EdTech tool has caught institutions\' attention and is loved and used by millions worldwide. EdTech has expanded and taken over the educational landscape. Chalkboard lessons are a thing of the past, slowly moving from dormancy to extinction. As education continues to shed new light on dark spaces, EdTech fully illuminates these dark spaces and brings infinite light.\xa0 This mushrooming new way of teaching and learning is constantly evolving, with new trends emerging every day. We haven\'t seen the end yet and anticipate even better future EdTech developments. An example of EdTech developments?  .

', 'For Snapchat’s first few years of existence, the media-sharing app was known for its rapidly disappearing photo and video messages. These short-lived messages encouraged candid and natural conversations, and quickly became a hit among Snapchat’s growing user base. However, users still wanted the ability to save some of their favorite pictures and videos. In 2016, Snapchat met this request with its introduction of Snapchat Memories. You may know  , but   is your ultimate guide to Snapchat memories – including how to make them, how to access them, who can see them,  , how to see your Snapchat memories year-end story for 2018. Click ahead to the section you’re looking for, or read on. Ready to get started? First things first – what exactly  Snapchat Memories? Snapchat Memories is a feature that enables users to save photos and videos for later instead of allowing them to disappear when the designated time is up. These snaps and stories are saved within Snapchat under your Memories tab and can be viewed, edited, sent, saved to your device, or reposted on your Snapchat story. This feature also grants users the ability to search their memories using keywords like “food” or “Thanksgiving”. Snapchat will then combine all of the saved memories that are relevant to your search and package them into a new, unique Snapchat story. This was an exciting move for Snapchat for a few reasons. As much as some users loved the self-destructing content, some were frustrated about the idea of spending the time to snap the perfect picture, only to have it almost-immediately disappear. However, to search through your memories, you have to have some! Luckily, creating Snapchat Memories is simple. If you know  , then creating Snapchat Memories will come especially easy for you! To start, open up your phone and launch your Snapchat app. Open up the Snapchat camera and snap a picture or take a video. Make sure that if you want to add a caption, doodle, filter, or geofilter, you do so now – before you save the snap to your memories. Once your Snapchat looks the way you’d like it to, you can save it to your memories by pressing the save icon in the bottom right corner. Contrary to popular belief, this does   save the photo or video to your camera roll. It saves it to your memories! When you press that button, the picture or video you just took will automatically store with the rest of your memories, a photo album stored within the Snapchat app for easy access and quick repurposing. You\'ll know you were successful if you see a pop-up that says "Saved to Memories!" You can even gain some   from saving snaps and stories to your Snapchat Memories, so the more you make, the better! Next up, we’ll show you just where to find those precious memories. To access your Snapchat Memories, first grab your smartphone and launch your Snapchat app. Open up the Snapchat camera, but instead of taking a picture or video, press the button directly below the recording button (it sort of looks like a pair of fanned-out cards). This will open up all of your Snapchat Memories, which you can then sort by pictures and videos that you saved individually   entire stories that you saved altogether. These memories will be displayed in reverse-chronological order, with the most recent snaps that you saved appearing up at the top. Individual photos and videos you’ve saved will appear as a rectangle. If you saved an entire story at one time, it will appear as a circle (which you can see in the image below). The best part about Snapchat Memories is the ability to look back on them with your friends and family! To repost or send a Snapchat Memory, open up your Snapchat Memories and find the photo, video, or story you’d like to send. Tapping on the photo will open it up to your full screen – now, it should look like any other snap that’s ready to send. If you’d like to send the snap as is, simply press the blue arrow in the bottom right corner and select your recipients. They’ll know you’re sending a Memory, as opposed to a snap taken in the moment, because it’ll appear as a new chat instead of a new snap. The screen recording below will take you through the process. When your snap looks the way you’d like it to, click the blue button in the bottom right and send it to your desired recipient. Or, you can put it directly onto your Snapchat Story!\xa0 Good question! In a short answer, no – not unless you let them, that is. Unless you hand off your phone and allow somebody to scroll through your Snapchat memories, they aren’t able to see them. Snapchat Memories are   accessible to the public (or anybody but yourself) like, say, a Facebook album. However, if you’re nervous about somebody seeing particular snaps you’ve saved to memories, there’s a feature for that! Snapchat “My Eyes Only” allows you to store memories in a secret album protected by a passcode of your choosing. You can move a Memory to your “My Eyes Only” folder by pressing the menu button (three stacked dots) in the top right corner and selecting the “My Eyes Only” tab.\xa0 We’ve reached the time of year where all of our favorite social media platforms are helping us recap our year. We’ve all seen our   and our   – now, what about your Snapchat Year-End story? It’s the  Snapchat Memory. Your Snapchat 2018 Year-End Story is a compilation of some of the snaps you’ve saved to your Snapchat Memories. Snapchat will put these snaps into a short video highlighting travels, sunsets, laughs, music, selfies, and more – depending on the content of the snap itself. To view your Snapchat 2018 Year-End Story, access your Memories as your normally would. It will appear in your Memories with the title “My 2018 in Snaps.” Enjoy it by yourself, or, if you want to share, you can post it to your story or send it to your friends!

'], 4: ["With so many social media platforms, the internet can be an overwhelming place. And businesses, unfortunately, feel they have to be everywhere all of the time, on every social platform. But the issue with that is trying to spread your   so thin by obsessing over ever platform. We're here to tell you that not all social media platforms have the same value or hold the same weight as each other, which is why you should implement a social media audit to find out where to focus your efforts. Conducting a social media audit helps marketers gain key insights that can be used to refine future campaigns and tactics. By doing regular social audits, you can see what’s working and performing well, uncover new opportunities for your business to connect with customers, and make necessary operational changes based on feedback. If you’re new to conducting a social media audit, below are a list of steps to get started. First, round up all of the profiles you’re aware of and currently use. Then, search for your company name on Google. You may be surprised at the existing profiles out there with your brand name associated with them. Be sure to include any customer support or news-focused handles that may be used in addition to the main brand account, and don’t forget to look at untapped places, like Reddit, TikTok, Nextdoor, or Vimeo. If your CEO or thought leaders at your company are actively associating their personal brand with your company name, be sure to round up those profiles as well. In addition to traditional social media profiles, it’s a good idea to round up your   as well. Why? Review websites hold a lot of valuable customer feedback and intel. This can be key to understanding what your customers are looking for in a brand. Similar to social media accounts, review websites are often a gateway when potential customers are researching your brand. Make sure information is up-to-date and relevant to make the best impression. If your brand has multiple different social profiles, it’s important to record all URLs and relevant information about each profile. In addition to collecting each profile, be sure to look and see if each page is “on brand” and follows style guides with colors, profile and header images, links in bios, and profile bio information. Review any branded hashtags used and see if you’re considered a verified account across your social media pages, which can often be indicated by a checkmark next to the profile name. In addition, note if your accounts on online review websites are claimed, meaning, it is verified by your business and you have an admin login to manage your profile. Oftentimes, you may have a page out there associated with your brand that was created due to someone writing a review about it. It’s important to claim the associated profile handle to not only have autonomy of your brand voice and messaging, but also to help with your search ranking and visibility amongst potential customers. As you’re gathering your social profile handles in your social media audit, analyze your posting activity and content. We recommend taking a look at a year's view to analyze how frequently posts are going out on a channel, the average number of engagements, and follower count. When analyzing content performance, look at the top three most engaged posts per month, and then narrow that down to the top three most engaged posts for the year. From there, you can get a sense of the major trends and what is resonating most with your audience. You can also identify if the most engaged content was also in the majority of what was promoted on your account. For example, if you saw that your top-performing content was company culture-related, but you only posted one culture post a month, there might be an opportunity to increase that cadence in order to improve engagement. By natively logging into the account, you will have more insights and growth trends over time, however, it’s best if you have a social media management tool to help with capturing this information. These tools are beneficial in pulling data quickly so you can spend more time analyzing the trends rather than manually adding up numbers. There may be different   and segments for different social media platforms, and that’s completely normal. Start by looking where you have the most followers and engagements. When you identify what content is being engaged with the most, you should be able to see trends in how your audience reacts to certain content. Also consider the format of each platform and why people go there. For example, people go to LinkedIn to network. If your company culture content is performing best on LinkedIn, that audience may consist of your employees or potential candidates. People tend to use Twitter for news. If you’re noticing tips or industry-related insights performing best on Twitter, your audience there is potentially more business-focused and they’re looking to consume more information. If your product or service is best told through images or video, you want to consider using Instagram or TikTok to tell your story. In addition, look at what people are saying about your business on these different platforms. Use review insights,  , and listening tools to gather feedback directly from consumers to understand what is most important to them. This can help with tailoring your content strategy. Once you’ve gathered the critical information about your business, start evaluating current content and see if it matches your brand voice and where your audience spends time. Where are people coming for customer support questions? For example, you may have a branded Twitter account for company news, but also a branded Twitter account for customer service inquiries only. If the customer service account isn’t getting much traction, and people are coming to the Twitter account for company news when looking to have a customer service question answered, maybe it’s time to reconsider if the customer service-focused account is necessary or serving a purpose. Where is the most website traffic coming from? Think about your end business goals and pay attention to where your audience is coming from when they visit your website. Places like YouTube or Pinterest might be larger traffic drivers for you because it’s easier to optimize the content for SEO or provide evergreen value. You may want to invest more time here, or at the very least, investigate further if you’re noticing content is performing well. Are there outdated profiles? Some social media profiles have become obsolete over time (like Google+, for example). Take a look and see if there are any profiles that aren’t being used, or aren’t where your target audience is looking. It’s okay to not have a social presence everywhere, in fact, it’s better to focus on fewer channels that will have the most reach rather than try to be active on every single social media platform. In your initial Google search of your brand name, look for any duplicate pages or names of your brand used in other formats. You may come across fan accounts, regional profiles, fake profiles, or even groups used to discuss your brand. While it isn’t always common, it’s important to keep track of any pages that aren’t owned or managed by the brand’s social team. You can try to gain autonomy by first messaging the account, getting more information, and trying to claim ownership through discussion. If that doesn’t work, try reaching out to the support team directly. Be sure to look at the guidelines for getting an account removed to be sure that the profile is breaking any rules or the social network. You won’t always be able to claim every profile, but it’s important to try to gain autonomy of your voice, claim any brand names across networks to have in your future arsenal and to ensure nobody tries to impersonate your brand. Lastly, think about the bandwidth of your social media team and reasonably allocate time. Try to determine the highest potential channels to engage your current customers and prospects, and make those the priorities. In addition, think about what is more of a low-maintenance lift versus needing daily engagement. For example, managing your Google My Business profile would be a lower lift once your profile information is updated as opposed to managing your Instagram or Twitter profile where you may be answering direct messages in addition to regular posting and using Stories. Once you’ve gathered your profile information and have a good sense of your audience and top-performing content, define your desired goals and outcomes for using social media. Are there certain networks better for customer retention? Are you noticing some platforms are better for lead generation or connecting with prospects? Take note of how each channel should be used to help support your larger business goals. Now that you have all of the information to inform a strategy, you can start putting these pieces together. Decided how frequently you plan to post, what types of posts you want to go out, and what the messaging and design elements look like. It’s important to be sure that each platform’s posting strategy goes back to your larger goals, and your audience segments. Once you have a posting cadence decided, develop a content calendar and bucket out how each piece of content goes back to your goals. We recommend trying to plan out a month in advance and strategically decide your breakdown of content and how it will be shared to best resonate with each channel’s unique audience. Implementing change takes time, so don’t be afraid to start small and continue to build on the strategy. After a quarter of testing your new plan, compare the metrics. Have you seen a difference with engagements, followers, and even leads? Do smaller audits every quarter to reflect on how the strategy is working, if content is matching those larger business goals, and if your audience is engaged. You should also keep a tab on unauthorized pages, customer feedback on review websites and social media channels, and brand mentions. Getting started could feel overwhelming, which is why we put together a simple\xa0 template that goes through how to conduct a social media audit and keep track of all of your brand profile pages. At the end of the day, conducting a social media audit is a necessary part of understanding your audience and better catering to their interests. Just by conducting a social media audit, you can gain plenty of insights into how your audience relates to content and what they’re saying about your brand to better tailor your larger marketing and business strategies.

The term “native” in tech typically refers to something in its natural environment. When it comes to social media, native analytics will reside in the platform itself. Audrey explains this a bit more. Native social analytics can be useful for companies just getting started on social media. They’re a feasible, entry-level option for companies who don’t quite have the budget yet to commit to a social media tool. Your first priority on social media should be to put effort into building a following and a regular content schedule. After this, you’ll need to begin tracking the results from these efforts. Here’s what Marie says about tracking. Marie is spot on. Vanity metrics like comments, mentions, and retweets are useful on the surface but don’t contribute much to longer-term strategies. No two social media marketing campaigns will show the same picture, which is why it’s important to determine the right metrics ahead of time. Doing so will help you measure the campaign’s progress easier and with greater focus. Here’s Alexandra’s take on social media metrics for campaigns.

Whether you own a small business or have a dedicated marketing team working for you, you may feel like you simply don’t have the time, money, or proper resources to maintain a consistent and engaging presence online. But like it or not, social media has proven to be one of the most effective business tools for connecting with both current and potential customers — and it’s here to stay. Networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn allow you to communicate directly with your audience, which helps you spread brand awareness and can even turn your customers into brand advocates! It may seem overwhelming for one person to keep up with the 24/7 social media world while running a small business or managing a business’ broader marketing strategy. As a result, many small businesses turn to   to help them manage their social presence. In a survey conducted by  , about 50% of small-business owners said they planned to use social media as part of their marketing strategy in 2019. At the same time, however, the majority of small businesses said they only spend about two hours of their week on marketing efforts. If you can relate to these statistics, consider investing in a social media suite. These comprehensive solutions are popular among small businesses for their ability to handle all aspects of a social media marketing strategy within a single platform. With just one tool, you can manage, monitor and analyze information related to one or more social media accounts. Let’s say you have business profiles on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Rather than visiting each of these websites individually to post content, you could connect all three of these accounts to your social media suite and then plan, schedule and publish content to all three of your feeds. But getting your content out there is just one piece of a   strategy. It’s also important to understand your audience and measure how well you’re doing with the members of that audience. Thankfully, social media suites provide   tools, allowing you to track the performance of your campaigns, determine successful marketing tactics, identify trends, and understand audience demographics. Another major feature provided by most social media suites is  . Businesses use these tools to track mentions of their brand across social networks, promoting brand advocacy by thanking customers for sharing positive experiences and managing brand reputation by quickly responding to negative feedback. There are many social media products on the market that can help businesses manage their social media feeds. Likewise, there are just as many products that provide solutions for social media monitoring or analytics. The reason so many small businesses prefer social media suites is because they offer management, monitoring and analytics within a single product.

Many social media suites will support the most popular networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and LinkedIn.

Organizations are revisiting their business strategies and operating models to stay relevant in a highly competitive market. They are constantly looking for ways to deliver better customer experiences and address inefficiencies in their operations to optimize costs and gain new business.\xa0 Digital transformation is at the forefront of everyone\'s minds. Businesses are looking for digital solutions that can deliver results fast and are agile to help them pivot when required. The demand for IT solutions is skyrocketing. This is putting pressure on the central IT teams who are unable to meet the demand due to high costs and unavailability of skilled professional developers resulting in IT backlogs and frustrated business units. This is where citizen   comes in. hese applications are created using development methods and runtime environments that are approved and sanctioned by the IT department, which separates this from the concept of shadow IT. Citizen developers are generally members of business units who want a solution for their unique problem and are ready to take advantage of new tools and applications to solve these issues themselves. Since digital dexterity is on the rise, most employees have the potential to become citizen developers who can create applications on their own given the right tools. Currently, citizen development is most prevalent in departments like HR, operations and admin, R&D, finance, customer service, and others. Rising IT backlogs and the shortage of skilled professional developer is evident across organizations in all industries.\xa0 Industry research estimates that by 2024, there will be a   in the US. On top of that, as technology has gained a more important place in our lives through the introduction of various gadgets and tools, there has been a rise in digital literacy. The ease with which employees can use and apply different features of today\'s technology is unparalleled, and it bodes well for introducing additional innovative tools. This is incredibly beneficial to companies as they can harness it to encourage employees to create the digital solutions they need. This is where citizen development can help. Citizen development provides a method for companies to address the IT backlog issue by enabling non-technical employees to create the applications they need without writing any code. As applications can also be created significantly faster, this saves time and money for the organization while allowing the IT department to focus on strategic ventures. Citizen developers are business users and employees first, which means that they are constantly on the lookout for the best solution to a business problem instead of focusing on the technology they are using. As business users have become more interested in finding and creating digital solutions to their problems, this has led to a surge in creating tools specifically directed toward non-technical users. Citizen developers don\'t have a wealth of knowledge regarding coding, so these new tools have built-in features to enable citizen developers to build digital applications with very little (low-code) or no-coding (no-code) at all. These tools are broadly classified as   tools.  tools provide an intuitive visual and graphic interface where users can assemble multiple "blocks" of pre-written code into the structure that they want, just like using lego blocks.\xa0 By abstracting the code and assembling it into "blocks," these tools allow users to mix and match the elements they need, leading to efficient and easy application development. These tools can help in various industries and functions, including application development, automation, workflow management, business process management, and more.  tools are geared strictly toward non-technical employees who cannot code at all. This enables them to diversify their talents and opportunities and reduce the burden on the IT department. Business users can easily use these tools to automate their repetitive tasks, eliminate paperwork and become more efficient.\xa0 On the other hand,   are geared toward individuals who have some pre-existing knowledge of coding. Unlike no-code tools, low-code tools allow users to write custom code making it more flexible in customization. However, low-code tools need more governance as they are susceptible to security threats introduced through handwritten code by the citizen developers.  serve a different purpose and have managed to spur citizen development by providing efficient tools for both technical and non-technical users alike. This helps with democratizing development, as any employee can utilize these tools to create their own bespoke solutions, where earlier they would have had to ask the IT department to help.\xa0 This also provides the citizen developers an opportunity to utilize their domain knowledge and personal understanding of problems that they face to create applications that solve very specialized issues in the industry. Solving such a problem would be more challenging for a member of the IT department due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the business problems and their corresponding solutions. Today low-code no-code tools can be used for a wide variety of  . Here are some of the popular ones: As citizen development rises in popularity, it\'s fulfilling specific needs in the market for developers; the deficit created due to a lack of professional developers in the industry who can help companies achieve their digital and technological goals. However, there are multiple types of citizen developers who have different interests and strengths. Here\'s a breakdown of the different types of citizen developers: Here are a few fundamental aspects which can help differentiate between citizen developers and professional developers: Every company can benefit from introducing citizen development to their employees, regardless of their size or scale. Citizen development can help you mobilize your workforce toward solving unique problems through various low-code and no-code tools.\xa0 This shift toward encouraging innovation and increasing efficiency can have a far-reaching impact on fostering a forward-thinking and digitally dexterous workforce. Citizen development equips those closest to the business to address their challenges without depending on central IT teams. There are numerous benefits to using citizen development in your company; here are just a few: Citizen development is a trend that can help a business become more productive and reach its goals consistently by democratizing development. Here are a few advantages and disadvantages to this phenomenon.\xa0 Citizen development can sometimes feel uncontrollable as it is based on the idea of giving your employees the freedom to create and build whatever tools and applications they need. However, without a well-designed method of governance, citizen development could turn into shadow IT quickly. Shadow IT is the use of hardware or software by an employee that has not been permitted or cross-checked by the IT department. Unsanctioned software and hardware run the risk of causing security challenges, lack of standardization, slow implementation, and lack of modernization in the long run. However, governing your citizen development with the following tips can turn . Digital transformation is a buzzword that\'s been on everyone\'s mind currently. Digital transformation is the process of using digital technology and software to enhance or rethink strategies, products, and assets to deliver the best value on an enterprise level. This process has become exceedingly important in our technology-dominated world. Each company needs to be able to put its best foot forward through its digital presence and processes. This can be done by digitally transforming the company from the ground up. Citizen development can help spur on digital transformation by empowering business users with tools that enable them to create the applications that they need. More and more companies have already started reaping the benefits of this initiative with an increased focus on introducing citizen development tools to their employees.\xa0 Citizen developers have in-depth knowledge about their daily roles and requirements, so it makes sense that they\'re the best people to find repetitive and time-consuming processes and tasks that can be automated to save time and money. Utilizing no-code and low-code applications has allowed non-technical users without any knowledge of coding to create enterprise-grade applications and automate workflows easily. Empowering the workforce with easy-to-use technology that can simplify their daily work and create a more productive environment is perfect for encouraging digital transformation on the whole. With some technical training and governance, these business users can also help lessen the burden on the IT department, leading to an increased focus on enterprise-wide holistic solutions. Citizen development also helps to promote increased digital dexterity throughout the organization, which can lead to the employees picking up technology more quickly and easily in the future. Everyone is curious about citizen development and digital transformation, and some of the best resources are available on the web in the form of podcasts, eBooks, websites, forums, and more. You can check out a few great resources through this . Motivated and technologically-adept individuals at all levels of the company can become frontrunners for this initiative, leading to more efficiency and more productivity.\xa0 Utilizing no-code and low-code tools can also help you speed up your digital transformation journey, especially if the entire workforce is involved in coming up with innovative and creative solutions for unique problems. Citizen development might be the key to ensuring that digital transformation goes smoothly in your company. ', 'More than 25% of total revenue and   across industries are generated by the  . Yet launching a new product or concept is often difficult and even unsuccessful, with less than half of all product launches meeting their target goals. With this in mind, how can brands improve their product innovation to help themselves quickly reach a favorable outcome? Agile innovation is the answer.\xa0\xa0 Concept testing can take place during a number of  phases. While it’s preferable that concept testing happens before the maturity of a product, it can occur at any stage of the life cycle. For example, a unique place in the life cycle for testing is during saturation, during which new products might develop out of a brand’s legacy offering. Finally, if a product or market is on the decline, fire drill concept testing may need to take place. Cisco wanted to transition from waterfall to agile methodologies, and implement new features as needed rather than launching major updates in siloed batches. By implementing   (a framework for scaling agile methodology), Cisco was able to decrease major defects by 40% and eliminate the need for after-hours work from employees, among other benefits. There are a number of agile research methodologies. Some of the most common are below. The goal of  is to guide development, decrease rework, and increase workflow. This method is also inherently collaborative, as multiple stakeholders must work together to first define appropriate behavior before driving methodology behind it. Then, this methodology can move through three phases: discovery, formulation, and automation. methodology is driven by the user experience and encourages collaboration by involving the customer perspective, the development perspective, and the testing perspective. This test-driven combination is referred to as the “three amigos.” The end goal of this approach is to verify the function of the system (or product) as intended. Exploratory testing is done with a workflow in mind. Instead of occurring in steps, this type of testing runs multiple steps in tandem: learning, test design, and test execution. This approach values individuals and interactions over tools and processes. There is no shortage of data in the world, the challenge is deciding how to act on it . While a brand can obviously implement data to improve a product offering, there are a number of other uses for data.\xa0 Traditionally, finding samples is the bain of market researchers’ existence. Vendors act as a middle man between researchers and the community they need to access, and .project management teams are tasked with mediating this process. However, new types of sample strategies are starting to emerge that are more accessible and faster to identify.\xa0 What does it take to move like a startup? Agile thinking and action. Aim to better understand your consumer needs, improve your brand’s new product development, optimize your marketing strategy, reduce your time to market, and always keep your customers coming back for more when you set your brand on the path to agile thinking. ', "For many organizations, innovation is one of the central business functions guiding their future growth.\xa0 Today, to remain stagnant with   offerings in the marketplace is an inadvisable tactic. Evolution the only viable option for sustaining competitive business advantage.\xa0\xa0 However, while around   believe that innovation is very important, a large majority of companies only focus on making incremental changes to their offerings and admit they are at a significant risk of disruptive innovation from competitors.\xa0\xa0 Innovation teams would argue that innovation is all about vision and execution; to effectively innovate, organizations need to carefully focus on the strategic process of innovation management. To help breakdown the innovation management process, we put together a comprehensive guide on the mechanisms involved in executing a powerful innovation program.\xa0 In the innovation sphere, it is well-established that innovation can be broadly categorized into three types: sustaining, disruptive, and radical innovation. To effectively manage an innovation program, it's important to understand under which category your initiative fits under.\xa0 Sustaining Innovation is all about making gradual improvements to a product, service, or process. This form of innovation is fundamental to keeping businesses afloat and accounts for the majority of a company’s budget allocated to innovation spending.\xa0 Disruptive innovation takes it up a notch. Disruption is usually a word thrown around in association with the word innovation. Think companies like Uber or Airbnb, which have created business models that disrupted or created new markets and acknowledged consumer demands which previously weren’t addressed.\xa0 Radical innovation is the game-changer. It’s the ultimate goal innovation visionaries dream about; this kind of innovation is about creating solutions to needs consumers were not even aware existed. Radical innovations have the power to completely change the way the world functions and have a significant impact on the daily lives of people. Take, for example, the creation of Facebook which pioneered digital communication as we know it.\xa0 Innovation is an incredibly collaborative exercise that requires the right kind of   to succeed. For effective management of innovation programs, it is a fundamental requirement that the organizational environment sets parameters that foster a culture of innovation. These parameters include the following conditions:\xa0 One of the most important factors for fostering an organizational culture of innovation is strong C-Suite leadership. Innovative leaders project a clear vision of the future and help to inspire innovative thinking. They instill trust through their expertise and encourage teamwork and collaboration. Without support from upper management, innovation has no grounding and no framework to grow.\xa0 Innovation is about vision and imagination, to quote Einstein, “Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.” To advance innovation, businesses need to remove barriers that inhibit freethinking and create environments that spark imagination and creativity.\xa0 Thoughts are important, but actions are just as significant. Organizations need to stimulate innovative behaviors by going back to organizational psychology 101: use positive reinforcement to stimulate productive behaviors in employees. Encouragement and openness are key to progress and behaviors that promote innovation need to be advanced.\xa0\xa0 You can’t just sit back and let innovation come to you—make it happen with a clear, goal-oriented   that aligns with your business strategy and is guided by consumer needs. A strategy is critical to management activity. Before executing an innovation program, businesses need to understand how their   fits into their overarching organizational goals. However, many companies still grapple with the challenge of aligning their innovation strategy with their business strategy. Sixty-five percent of companies investing 15% or more of their revenue in innovation   that this alignment is one of their top strategic challenges. To ensure alignment with business strategy, innovation managers need to carefully refine each strategic step of their program.\xa0 As with any good strategy plan, an innovation management strategy needs to begin with defining the goals of the program. Goals set within an innovation program should reflect business strategy goals. The goals of the innovation program can vary greatly—from objectives set to generate revenue by improving or creating products to designs initiated to improve   and satisfaction or business operations.\xa0 At its core, innovation is about addressing the ever-changing and evolving needs of the consumer. Innovation departments need to employ insights from their internal teams as well as third-party consultants who have experience in different organizations and sectors, to develop a broad and holistic understanding of consumer trends.\xa0 Within   what's most important to consider is that consumers don't always know what they need. This is the space that disruptive and radical innovation fills. Take, for example, Ford Motors. Henry Ford revolutionized the transportation industry by creating a new process of mass production for the car in a time where the transportation needs of the consumers were focused around faster horses and bigger chariots. Through the innovation of mass production, Henry Ford created a need that consumers did not know they had. To establish a serious competitive foothold in the market, the creation of the consumer need is crucial. The tactic an organization employs to develop innovation can vary; they may build it, partner with providers to develop it, or buy it from a third-party. Broadly speaking, sources of innovation can be defined as either internal innovation and external innovation.\xa0 As the name would suggest, internal innovation comes from within an organization. This is not just limited to an innovation or R&D department; internal innovation can come from any department within an organization. At large multinational companies, encouraging innovation across the board can often be a challenge because of barriers such as proximity to innovation departments, language, and even timezone issues. Internal innovation is where fostering a culture of innovation really counts. Ensuring that management is on-board and that the organizational environment encourages free-thinking and innovative behavior is key to overcoming internal innovation challenges and  . External sources of innovation can come from anywhere outside the walls of an organization. Sources can include  , vendors, academic partners, accelerators and incubators, as well as innovation communities. A popular tactic employed by innovative companies is to launch an open call for innovation, utilizing a platform facilitated by an innovation management software provider to incentivize external communities to contribute ideas. Open calls are one of the most effective means of sourcing innovation today.\xa0 While technically falling under the category of external innovation, startup innovation really deserves its own heading. Today,  . As much as the word innovation gets thrown around corporate boardrooms, the application of innovation strategy can often prove difficult in these organizations because of outdated corporate structures.\xa0 Startups are different—they work on   and lean methodologies that create environments more likely to foster innovation. For this reason, organizations look to partner with and acquire startups as one of the central focuses of their innovation strategy, and rightfully so given startups’ dominance of the innovation space.\xa0 Idea generation is incredibly crucial for innovation. For effective management of innovation programs, it is important that ideas are gathered and then taken through a systematic process of development. The innovation funnel is a mechanism employed by innovation teams to conceptualize the process of idea generation to solution output. The model centers around a process of idea divergence and convergence, and keeping track of metrics along the way.\xa0 The first step of the innovation funnel involves the gathering of a lot of ideas. Here, organizations can employ numerous tactics to source ideas and innovation from both internal and external communities. Ideas are accepted based on predefined criteria set according to the overarching strategy of the program. In order to approach the process of idea generation in a systematic way, many organizations decide to utilize a   to help them accept, store, and evaluate ideas in the most effective way.\xa0 The next step is to capitalize on the best ideas. The process of converging ideas involves carefully narrowing down and filtering ideas that are relevant to the business. Involving stakeholders from all relevant departments to help evaluate and develop the best ideas is important here. Testing and evaluating ideas at multiple stages is crucial. Metrics are the final part of the innovation management strategy. Before any new innovation is put out in the market innovation teams need to establish how they will measure the success of their programs.\xa0 The technological innovations that advanced in the 20th century were made possible by growth in the fundamental knowledge and scientific innovation in the 19th century. Back then, product evolution that took centuries was hailed as rapid innovation. Today, however, innovation moves at unprecedented speeds, taking much shorter spans of time to advance from idea to solution. This rate of movement puts significant pressure on organizations to be innovative in order to remain competitive and relevant.\xa0 Spending on innovation is on the up, with companies expecting that between 2017 and 2020, their   is will rise by more than 25%, with one-third of those same companies expecting to raise their investment by more than 50%.\xa0 Innovation is a clear priority for many companies, however, it's no easy task. For an organization to ensure they are on the right track, they need to understand the innovation they want to develop, create an organizational environment that fosters innovation, and engage in a systematic and strategic process of innovation management.

I had a front-row seat to learn what people liked about our product, how people used it, and the questions they had. Customer success allowed me to dive deep into our product, and understand the nitty-gritty details that make-or-break success with G2. A question I heard now and again was: "I have the G2  , what exactly should I do with it?" And while it might seem overwhelming to have all of this content at your hands with no guidance on what to do with it, there\'s no need to panic!\xa0 There are   different things you can do with G2 Content. And in this playbook, we’ll be walking you through a variety of ways to leverage it in sales, marketing, and more. Before I dive into the hows, whys, and numbers and plans, let’s take a step back.  G2’s Content Subscription allows you to share and repurpose your Grid, Index, and Compare reports, along with shareable social content. Packaging up your reviews in this way allows your customer voice to do the selling   and has been proven to be effective in engaging buyers, enhancing marketing programs and materials, and influencing deals and buyers. There are so many things included, some would even say it\'s a  :\xa0 Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s dive into how to use G2 Content to benefit marketing, sales, customer success, and product.\xa0 This is by no means an exhaustive list, but these are certainly the most common ways sellers just like you are leveraging their G2 Content as part of their outbound marketing strategies. What’s fun is, these tactics can be used in any combination. Some use them all while others focus on a few tactics most relevant to their business. For instance, if you know press releases don’t perform that well for you, but landing pages and social sharing do, start with those. If you know email nurture campaigns and infographics work well, and you’re still trying to figure out your ad strategy –prioritize your sweet-spot programs first. Just like in marketing as a whole, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. So prioritize what you do well, and enhance that with G2 Content first. From there, work with your G2 Rep to experiment with other use cases for G2 Content you’ve seen from other vendors (or even your competitors) in-market. Let’s get prescriptive, and go into detail on how each of these tactics is executed with G2 Content – examples included. With press releases, you can go one of two ways: This is by far the most popular way G2 customers share out the reports they license, and it’s not hard to see why. You’re bringing the best of both worlds together by building your brand and showcasing your users’ satisfaction with your product, while also leveraging a report as a demand capture tool to fuel your pipeline! For that reason, this is the top marketing tactic we recommend you prioritize when thinking through how to leverage your G2 Content Subscription. Use this landing page as the base for all of the other suggestions listed in this playbook to build a powerful campaign.\xa0 Looking for a quick (and proven) way to increase time on your website and collect more leads? Link to a G2 report you’re licensing on your website. Add a banner to your homepage so the report is front-and-center. Another common best practice is to add it to your resources page for the third-party validation of your product that buyers are looking for.\xa0 In our   report,   of respondents said they use a vendor website and   use public product review websites to evaluate and make purchase decisions on B2B goods/services. By making your G2 report easily accessible on your website, you\'re giving prospects the context and content to choose you. Once your landing page is ready, it’s time to make some noise on social! Share your report out organically in your normal social cadence, along with launching some sponsored posts on sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.\xa0 Looking for some help creating those visuals for your posts? We’ve got you covered thanks to the Social Asset Creation portion of the Content Subscription. Contact your G2 rep and we’ll get those social assets created for you.\xa0 With our integration with  , you can really bring your Content campaign full circle. After licensing your G2 reports, combine the power of those reports with the power of your G2 Buyer Intent to create a hyper-targeted campaign to your ideal customers. Extend your reach by creating display ads that lead to the landing page hosting your G2 report. Depending on your ideal customer profile (ICP), and the ad platform you use, consider which ads you display on specific channels to ensure they’re as relevant as possible to the persona you’re targeting.\xa0 Bid on branded competitor or industry-related terms to direct traffic to your G2-enhanced marketing and landing pages. Consider which reports you want to tie to specific keywords and search terms you’re bidding on. For instance, if someone is searching [YOUR PRODUCT] vs [COMPETITOR], a Compare Report would probably be best; if someone is searching [CATEGORY] software tools, a Grid Report is probably a better fit.\xa0 Blog posts are a great way to break your report into bite-size chunks, or to introduce the reports you want to share. G2’s Content Subscription gives you access to   of the reports your product is included in, creating a ton of content possibilities for you and your team. Looking to get a ton of runway out of the G2 content you’re featured in? Consider a blog series with each post covering an interesting component of the different reports you want to highlight. And if you want your blogs to generate demand, link to your landing pages to capture leads before giving prospects access to the full report. The possibilities here are limitless!\xa0 Hopefully, by now, we can all agree that buyers want reviews. In fact,  . Equipping your sales team with your G2 reports means you can help prospects confidently get the info they need before buying, faster. Create videos, slides, infographics, or even just give your reps access to the link to the report itself to help accelerate your pipeline. The unbiased, third-party evaluation of tools will help build trust between your team and your prospects, and acts as an instant differentiator for your reps and solutions in competitive situations.\xa0 For prospects already in your funnel, sharing your G2 reports via email can be a great way to move them even further down the funnel. Consider creating a series of emails based around the content in your G2 reports. Nurture and educate prospects and progressively build interest in your solution. And remember – email isn’t just for marketers! Create email templates for your sales and customer success teams to send individually as well.\xa0 Looking at data, charts, and graphs can be overwhelming for buyers -- especially if their time or attention is limited. That’s why taking the wealth of data in a G2 report and transforming it into an infographic is one of the best (and most visual) examples of using G2 to catch a prospect’s attention. Similar to the landing page, infographics can be used in combination with some of the other methods mentioned above. Consider including an infographic in a blog post, breaking the content infographic up into a series of nurture emails, and even providing a copy of the infographic to your sales and event marketing teams as a physical piece of collateral to share with prospects.\xa0 Yes, it can be done! Share your success in a G2 report out in the real world. We’ve seen a ton of creativity in this area, with prospects showcasing their G2 reviews, badges, and standing on billboards, bus ads, banners in airports, badges at events, and more. Looking for something to showcase in your office? Want to get your employees hyped, and create a culture of celebrating happy customers and great products? Consider putting some G2 content up on your walls!\xa0 Let’s look at a few specific case studies of how companies have used G2 Content and seen great results. But before we get into that, look what our friend Jonathan M., Director of Demand Gen at SolarWinds  :\xa0  used the Grid® Report they licensed in a few different ways: The results of those efforts drove more than 20% of total meetings for their sales teams. Looker also promoted it’s status as a Leader in the report with a Sponsored Content campaign on LinkedIn. They targeted their ideal prospects with the Business Intelligence Grid and according to LinkedIn, their campaign is consistently the top Sponsored Content across all technology advertisers. Looker’s LinkedIn Sponsored Content Campaign drove:  used their G2 Compare Report across all marketing channels to better engage and influence prospects at the bottom of the marketing funnel who were evaluating business intelligence solutions. Sisense ran LinkedIn sponsored content campaigns, targeting users with specific titles in computer software and healthcare. And to make the most of their budget –only promoted the report to relevant prospects and contacts. The G2 Compare Report helped Sisense to increase conversion rates with Google AdWords, while lowering the cost per acquisition and generating:  used the Help Desk Grid Report for validation against their competitors. The report helped them identify buyers actively looking to buy a help desk tool and provided use-based comparisons between TeamSupport and their competitors. ’s marketing team uses their G2 Compare Report to showcase how Yellowfin compares against their top competitors. Prospects engaged with Yellowfin’s nurture campaign receive the Compare Report via email when their lead score indicates they’re evaluating business intelligence solutions and has led to:  leveraged their Grid Report data to develop their own whitepaper, positioning themselves against their top three competitors. They’ve driven hundreds of downloads in the first month, outperforming their other campaigns. They created many of the best practices and tactics covered in this playbook, including a landing page, an infographic, retargeting ads, and emails.\xa0 Whether you’re looking to build (and showcase) brand value, demonstrate your leadership position, enhance and scale marketing, or over-support sales – G2 Content’s a great fit to take your results  Our team is dedicated to making sure you get the most out of your G2.

But reviews don't always come organically — most of the time, our team had to ask for them. You may be wondering, how on Earth did they get to  ? Honestly, so are we. A huge part of it was our strategy. As any good email marketer will tell you, the real opportunity for us was growing and cultivating our user list, while simultaneously understanding their motivation to join G2. Then, the number of reviews generated provided a natural starting point to articulate a success metric, and ultimately, a conversion point to aim for.  has an array of resources to offer. You can read expert content curated by our marketing and research teams, utilize our compare tools, and even write a review for a gift card or donation. People find G2 from all over, and we also help them find us by using paid social ads, vendor-run campaigns, and at marketing events. The point is, we need to manage all of these people to meet their expectations in different ways. Engaging our users with the content they want makes them stick around longer and find more value. We take our calls to action in emails very seriously because we have users looking to contribute a review for all kinds of reasons. They may want to help other professionals make better buying decisions, or they could just be looking for that free cup of coffee. Part of our segmentation includes handing specific users off to our marketing team, or running industry-specific tests for our Research content. It’s our job to make the user’s experience as tailored to them as possible. We've all heard that first impressions matter. That's because they do,   when it comes to email. We've gone through many iterations of the Welcome Email during my time here at G2. Starting with a lovely letter from our CEO, evolving to an email with more company branding, all the way to its current iteration where we guide users to self-selected content based on their persona type: vendor, reviewer, or buyer. Whichever option they choose has curated content that we follow-up with to help users continue on their own G2 journey. The next essential piece in our email strategy is transactional emails. Transactional emails are sent to users based on a behavior they take on the site. Our most common transactional email types are those that notify a user when their review has been rejected or approved, but we also have emails for password resets, lead submission confirmations, login info, and many more. We strive to make sure the data we provide in these transactional emails is timely, accurate, and relevant. Let’s flash back to our success metric: reviews. The majority of emails we send are in our promotional campaigns asking for reviews.\xa0 However, there are other steps before a recipient hits that “Submit Review” button after opening an email. We pay close attention to every single step along the way. Here’s where A/B testing really comes in handy. The most important thing to keep in mind is, “What am I measuring?” Optimizing subject lines, button colors, copy, and creative are all small parts that improve the whole user experience. While we’ve had glorious wins in the past, we’ve also learned some valuable lessons along the way, the most important of which is to keep reiterating on what we’re delivering. We’ve tested subject lines such as “10,000 pennies for your thoughts” (a clerical error on our part-we were only offering a $10 gift card) and we’ve tried to make emojis work (proving the poop emoji just doesn’t work for everyone). We’ve pulled off some wildly creative content working with our data team to build out visual graphs in our Year in Review email. Sometimes, it’s as simple as getting a birthday wrong, and engaging with our users in a playful way. All of these seemingly small tests have evolved our email templates over the years, and I can confidently say for the better. \xa0 I would not be doing my due diligence to our email strategy if I did not mention one of the most challenging, but rewarding, obstacles I’ve faced during my time at G2… twice. Migrating email service provider (ESP) tools. If you find yourself going through this process, all I can say is have faith. Like most challenges, it seems more overwhelming than it is. As a rule of thumb, the most important thing is to stay on the same page as your development team at all times! This is so important because the second most critical thing is building out the data requirements for your new platform. When building out our requirements, we included questions like: As you’re imagining, this process involved a lot of shared spreadsheets, and even more communication. It’s like the old saying goes, “measure twice, cut once.” Only in this case it’s “check your data twice, implement once.” Having a good project manager on the team to keep everyone on pace and track followup items was crucial for us during both these processes. Personalization is what I like to refer to as the FName affliction. Every email marketer knows how to put a custom tag in their email that references the recipient's first name: “Hi Clara, We’d really like you to leave a review.” Personalization  critical to our email strategy, because we want the user to feel important, but we wanted to stop relying on just FNAME. So we started testing user images in the banners to improve how we personalized our emails to each user. As you can see, personalization is essential in making our users feel special, but to really upgrade our email marketing strategy we use customization. Customization, for us, is understanding our users at many dynamic levels, and that’s where timely, accurate and relevant messaging comes in. We tailor messaging at the beginning of the user experience based on which channel they came in through. We collect data such as job title so we can direct users to categories of software related to what they’re most likely using. We’re now engaging with our users using different types of content such as video reviews and Q&A. We use our data to ask users to participate in discussions about the products they’ve already reviewed or indicate they use. Customization for us isn’t going on autopilot and including FName, but it’s using data in a way that consistently surprises and delights our users. Email has been one of the most impactful channels for G2’s growths, and also evolved into a passion for me. Setting up clear goals and optimizing each step of the process has allowed us to fine-tune our user experience. Challenges like switching up ESP tools, leaning into customization, transactional emails, and welcome series should be viewed as opportunities, not obstacles in your email strategy. All of these aspects of email marketing have become essential nuts and bolts on our rocket ship to 1 million reviews.

"], 21: ['The underlying components that make up AI today:  ,   and  —have existed in an evolving form for many years. Over the past year or so, software application vendors started experimenting with embedding AI into business software applications. This approach of embedding AI capabilities into the workflow of the applications (better referred to as “intelligent applications”) will continue to grow in 2017 and beyond. The first function, automating simple, routine tasks, is straightforward and relieves users from tasks that distract and consume time, allowing them to focus on higher-value tasks. An example would include virtual assistants that manage schedules, providing the capability to coordinate meetings without user intervention. An AI agent could also perform tasks that require coordination of available data into an output, like a project plan, a resupply order or even a bill of materials. These examples offer some idea of the potential of intelligent applications and the potential for many other use cases across every business area. ', 'The evolution of artificial intelligence has seen its impact in various industries.\xa0 AI can be seen from the medical field all the way to  . In its simplest form, AI has been implemented in many industries as a   for customer communications such as online help centers. In its more complicated form, AI has been used to actually learn from collected data and make decisions or predictions based on that data. This is called  , a subset of AI.\xa0 Machine learning has been implemented in many creative ways, but one of it most recent implementations may just send a shiver down your spine. With the right information,   can  for a set of people with accuracy unmatched by doctors and the most commonly used algorithms alike.\xa0 A recent study attempted to use AI to predict premature deaths with the health data of more than  , nearly 14,500 who died sooner than the nation average mainly from cancer, heart disease, and respiratory diseases. The data came from the UK Biobank, an open-access database of genetic, physical, and health data. After providing the AI system with said data, it was asked to compute the likelihood of each individuals’ premature mortality, specifically from chronic disease. Within the study, two types of AI were tested: “deep learning” and “random forest”.\xa0 , a subset of machine learning, attempts to replicate the human processing of data by using algorithms inspired by the human brain. This algorithm reports the outcomes of “tasks” or scenarios that it has run over and over again, altering the scenario each time to further improve its outcome, which in this case is its mortality prediction.\xa0 , another subset of machine learning, consists of a cluster of what are called decision trees. Decision trees distribute the collected data into specific classifications by using a yes/no branching system. In our case, these “classifications” are whether or not an individual is likely to die due to chronic illness. The classifications are collected from all the decision trees in the random forest and the most common classification is deemed the algorithm’s prediction. Researchers compared predictions gathered from these deep learning and random forest algorithms and compared them with one of the most commonly used early mortality predictors: the Cox model.\xa0 Deep learning, random forest, and the Cox model all focused heavily on variables such as age, gender, and smoking history, but the models diverged on variables such as ethnicity and physical activity – things the Cox model put a heavy emphasis on. Deep learning alone put a heavier emphasis on variables such as the use of certain medications, alcohol intake, and exposure to job related hazards and air pollution.  The Cox model proved to be no match for the AI methods as it was only able to predict a meger   that occured between 2006 and 2016 while the deep learning and random forest algorithms correctly identified 76 percent and 64 percent of subjects respectively that died during the same time period. While these statistics are quite the accomplishments for AI, this is hardly the first time that it has been used to make medical predictions and assumptions. In 2017, researchers developed an AI algorithm that was able to analyze PET scans of potential Alzheimer’s candidates and   who would go on to develop the memory impairment disease. In other studies, AI has also been used to predict onset autism, likelihood of heart attack or stroke, and has even been able to identify signs of encroaching diabetes. Although AI’s ability to predict early mortality appears to be rather grim reaper-esque, it is quite the opposite. Identifying people who are at risk of dying early can allow physicians to point to this likelihood and provide patients with ways to lower their chances of dying young, using AI to effectively fight off the grim reaper rather than being it. The current state of AI is amazing and can be incredibly useful to just about every industry, but as technology continues to advance, the capabilities of AI are assuredly going to grow along with it.\xa0 ', 'Eighty\xa0percent of enterprise companies are currently investing in   (AI) solutions,  .\xa0 '], 0: ["Today’s business landscape is extremely competitive, which is why establishing your brand and distinguishing it from others is so important. Think about it. Everything from your company’s logo, its name, slogan, and even color palette are how customers recognize your brand. A lot of time and preparation goes into your   strategy, so protecting it from misuse and outside interference is vitally important. One of the best ways to ensure your brand is protected is by registering a trademark. Registering a trademark may sound intimidating at first, but the process is actually smoother than most think. Visit the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO)\xa0  to get started. It generally takes up to six months of filing an application to receive a response. Recognizing the difference between the three USPTO forms is crucial to getting your application approved as quickly as possible. Below is a breakdown of each form: This option is by far the most comprehensive. Applicants will need to provide an email address and respond to any inquiries from a USPTO representative. They must also select their   from the trademark identification manual. Finally, applicants must specify additional statements in their application. Such as: That’s a lot of paperwork, however, there are some advantages to the TEAS Plus form.  The cost of this application is only  , making it the most inexpensive. Also, the amount of information provided in this form means it   get approved quicker than others. Applicants selecting this option must also provide an email address to keep in touch with a USPTO representative. Any additional information needed by the USPTO must be submitted online.  The cost of this application is  , but the reduced amount of paperwork needed to file the form could make the process less cumbersome. There’s not much to say about the TEAS Regular form, other than the applicant pays   to submit it. Unfortunately, more information is typically required when registering a trademark. So it’s worth following up with the USPTO if selecting this option. For further clarity, here’s a video courtesy of the USPTO explaining each form and its filing process. Don’t jump the gun when sending your trademark application. A bit of research will need to be conducted ahead of time. First, ensure the trademark you’re registering for isn’t currently taken. This will lead to an immediate contention of your application. Of course, sifting through millions of trademarks is impossibly time-consuming. Fortunately,   automates this job and even assists in the property management lifecycle. Any trademark that is too vague or similar to other filed trademarks may be contested as well. In this case, it might be worth consulting with an   to map out your best options. Many elements of pop culture and society are defined by dynamic, longstanding brands. Slogans like “built Ford tough.” Designs like McDonald’s golden arches. Figures like the Dos Equis' “most interesting man in the world.” These companies made sure to protect what makes them recognizable and unique. They couldn’t have done it without trademarking. For companies with ambitions to scale greatly, it’s worth registering trademarks and securing brand elements its teams have worked diligently to create. It’s a vital step in securing your  .

Unfortunately, adding more money to the equation is like putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg. Without a focused marketing plan in place, your ad spend is often wasted on poorly optimized and misguided campaigns.\xa0 By strengthening the pillars that make up your marketing campaign, an advanced marketing strategy allows you to build a holistic battle plan to conquer your competitors, increase your conversion rate, and form lasting relationships with your customers. Whether you have an existing marketing campaign or are starting from scratch, these ten advanced marketing strategies will help you boost traffic, increase conversions, and take your business to the next level. Great marketing results don't just happen by chance – they rely on consistency. This applies to all aspects of your content, from the tone to topic and timing.\xa0 The first step in achieving consistency is to create a roadmap that outlines your scheduled content topics and lay out when you plan to reach certain targets. Creating a marketing framework prepares you for upcoming campaigns well ahead of time.\xa0 This means that instead of rushing your content, you can create detailed briefs for your writers and still have ample time to edit and publish, ensuring you consistently produce high-quality content.\xa0 It’s difficult to achieve consistency if you don’t have a streamlined production process. The best way to achieve this is to have an in-house team working on your marketing assets, all the way from conception to publication.\xa0 If this isn’t possible, stick to using only one   to manage this process for you. As with many things in life, timing is key. An effective marketing framework helps you time your content publishing to align with peak seasons. Instead of letting the festive season sneak up on you yet again, you could be the first brand creating festive cheer among consumers.\xa0 Remember that quality content is wasted if no one is viewing it. It’s important to identify which customer acquisition channels work well for your business and the ones that are dead ends. Your product offering is the heart of your business. An unsuccessful launch can be very expensive and negatively affect your brand reputation. So it’s worth taking the time to do thorough   to identify who your product will provide value to.\xa0 An important part of product research is identifying your target audience.

Some great marketing techniques to draw more attention to your products include adding discounts on popular products or giving away free gifts to new customers.\xa0 You can cross-sell or upsell products at discounted prices. While lower prices can hurt your profit margins, overall sales and revenue will likely increase as a result of more orders. When you’re focused on driving sales, don’t fall into the trap of placing all your attention on lead generation. Spending all your resources on finding new customers can make you forget about your existing customers. Repeat customers are an important asset for your business and can become loyal brand advocates if you nurture them.\xa0 Referral programs are a great way to encourage existing customers to engage with your brand while driving new customers to your platform.\xa0 If you sell a software-based product, offering free trials is a clever strategy to help customers see the value of your product and what they’ll be missing out on once the free trial period ends. Free trials can be offered to new customers, or as a way to promote upgrades to existing customers.

If you have followed so far, you probably have insights into how to hone in on your target audience, boost traffic on your site, and which platforms you should tailor your marketing campaigns to.\xa0 All of these strategies put eyes on your content, so the next thing you need to focus on is the content itself. The online market is saturated with advertisements and promotional content. It’s easy to make your content all about you, but it’s important to remember that you’re not the person you’re trying to sell your products to.\xa0 As discussed earlier, the best way to give your brand value is to appeal to an existing problem or pain point for your customers. Cut through the noise and distractions by creating story-driven content that focuses on your target audience and explains how your product or service helps them. By putting your customers at the center of the story, you’re helping them see how your product or service can be an integral part of their lives. You want your product or service to be the customer’s knight in shining armor, swooping in to save the day just when the customer needs you most.\xa0 A great way to ensure your content pops up at the right moment is to use APIs to tailor the content your leads see based on their behaviors.

People are naturally drawn to images of other people. Using models to demonstrate the product is a great way to increase your conversion rate.\xa0 This gives consumers a better understanding of the size and functionality of your product.

Menus, toolbars, and buttons may need to be moved around to improve your website’s ease of use on mobile devices. By combining a seamless searching experience on mobile with optimized local SEO searches, you stand a good chance of dramatically increasing your site’s conversion rate.

They are responsible for the overall brand image and ensuring that it properly resonates with its target market. To accomplish this, they have to analyze and stay on top of market trends, carefully watch the competition, and lead marketing and advertising campaigns to ensure the brand image is upheld. To get the best sense of what a brand manager does, let’s hear from Daleep Chhabria, the former Senior Brand Manager for Call of Duty in the UK and Rest of Europe: “The brand manager has to define the brand, find its audience, build and strengthen the connection between the brand and its audience, and then grow the audience while building and guarding the brand using the full   to support sales to achieve targets. This typically begins with strategic   like defining the brand’s name and how it will look, which is usually achieved by briefing creatives and agencies. A brand manager must also define important elements such as the value proposition,  , and more. These components are essential when communicating your brand and its objectives to the wide variety of people it will be exposed to. With the sales targets and audience defined, the budget needs to be split and spent across the marketing mix into various tactics. For example, packaging (if relevant), website development, promotions, public relations, advertising, content creation, social media, and more. Depending on budgets, some of this is done by the brand manager, some by their team, and some by agencies. Brand managers should also leverage what they can achieve in the press, usually through a PR expert or agency. The other area a brand manager should support is sales, either through the actual sales team or by having direct contact with customers, especially if operating within a value chain.” As with any career, salaries vary greatly depending on the company you work for, the city you work in, and specific titles and responsibilities you have. Remember, these numbers are country-wide averages, so take this information with a grain of salt. With a lot of hard work, dedication, and talent, there is truly no telling what your potential earned salary can be! According to Glassdoor, the average salary of a brand manager in the United States is $96,333. It’s noted that additional compensation is typical and can range anywhere from $11,667 to $27,859. Keep in mind that brand managers can go by a slew of other titles within the company while taking on additional related marketing duties. In this case, you might be curious to know that a typical marketing manager earns an average of $81,078, making it clear that having a specialized role and tailored responsibilities yield higher earnings. Becoming a successful brand manager takes time, and the only way to gain the valuable skills needed is through experience that you’ll accumulate throughout the years on the job. Of course, there are still skills that you should have and refine while building up the experience you need to move forward. Some of these skills are a no brainer, but others might surprise you. Possessing innovative creativity while still having the ability to think analytically is not an easy task and not everyone is skilled at it. This is a job that will call on the skills of both sides of your brain, which is why It’s so important to be well rounded as a brand manager. What better way to learn the ins and outs of the brand manager career path than from those currently in the role? To get the best understanding of what it’s really like, I asked successful brand managers in a variety of industries what their typical days look like, lessons they’ve learned while on the job, and any advice for those aspiring to break into the industry. Here’s what they said: “Being a brand manager is an all-in-one job: a bit of a brand strategist, UX designer, data analyst, and project manager. I usually describe my job as being a Product Owner, but the Product is the whole brand. My brand is growing faster than ever, and our branding needs to keep up with all those changes. With that pace, it’s not easy, especially when more and more new people are involved in the brand’s communication. To keep it all together and provide a state-of-the-art brand experience for both clients and employees you need one thing: coherence & repeatability.” “A typical day might include researching the marketplace to determine product-market fit, creating advertising strategies, designing ads, managing promotional activities, evaluating pricing and sales, or finding ways that the brand can expand to a wider audience.” “No two days are the same in branding. Depending on different client goals, I might be in a client’s office refining strategy and interpreting data for marketers, on the phone with journalists clarifying information and providing them with assets for a media placement, or out of town vetting industry-specific events to determine if building awareness there would be a strategic fit for our clients.” “A typical day includes strategy sessions, content writing, working with graphic designers, and pretty much every other associated team. You are steering the ship and guiding the vision of how you believe the brand should be represented - the common thread, tone, voice, values, and impressions you want your brand to make on your audience. So one day you may be outlining the goals you want the brand to achieve and the next day you are outlining the assets you have to help get you there, then you may spend two days writing content. Everything moves very quickly!” “This really varies from one brand marketer to another, based on the company's needs and the brand's maturity. For me, I typically start by reading up on my clients' deliverables and the project milestones that need to be completed for the day. I then review (and add to, if appropriate) recently posted content and check social media engagement. Then I go into brand campaign planning and status checks before diving into content writing and editing.” “An important tip for those aspiring to be a brand marketer is to always consider the user experience when developing your efforts. This can be their experience with a physical product or within a retail environment. One way to get more perspective on this is to actually immerse yourself into the environments. For example, in my role as a brand marketing manager, I spent about half of my time on the road and in stores to see how the brand was being executed at the ground level. Sometimes brand initiatives make sense on paper, but it's critical to see how they are being perceived on the ground level, both from a customer and employee execution standpoint. Another tip is to be very organized. There are a lot of moving parts in an organization and many details that go into the conceptualization of a brand or marketing of a service or product. Set daily schedules and goals and use visual project timelines like Gantt charts to track and sustain progress.” “Brand managers need to be great multitaskers and have the ability to see the big picture, or vision, and how many small elements fit into that vision. They also need to be comfortable in a leadership position as your job is to drive the brand forward.” “Communication is the most important characteristic to focus on. A brand manager's job should be open and honest. This means regularly engaging customers and responding to any questions or concerns they may have. Remember that one tiny mistake can affect your brand in a negative way, so be careful not to step on anyone's toes by being unreliable.” “Be passionate, have finesse, and be  . Branding is all about creativity and moving a client outside of their comfort zone. Take risks and be accountable for the outcomes of those risks. Remain strategic and keep client ROI top of mind and monitor how your efforts drive business. No one remembers a brand that plays it safe. There are a lot of dreamers in the field, and it’s important to remember that a client is going to be concerned with their bottom line and the return on their investment in branding. If you are managing a brand, you should always keep in mind how your outcomes can be measured.” “Form habits around your strengths. To be a successful marketer, you don’t need to be an expert in every channel, one or two areas of expertise will be enough. However, experiment first with a bunch of different skills to see what is the best fit for you!” “You need to have both vision and skill - be adaptable and focused. Ultimately this is not a role for a rinse-and-repeat personality. Know that not everything is going to go as planned, and you will need to embrace this ambiguity.” “Try to be clear on what your brand actually is. A company’s brand isn't what the leaders want it to be, it's how the target consumers actually perceive it. In order to improve something, you must first identify it properly.” “It helps to have studied marketing to get into brand management, but it's not essential. If you're passionate about getting into brand management, there's a lot you can do to build your understanding. Read marketing publications, case studies, analyze a brand's marketing activities to try and figure out the strategy and objectives for yourself! My absolute favorite tip for anyone without a job in brand management - build one because you learn by doing.” “I studied marketing and picked the best companies I wanted to work for. I got those opportunities through a combination of relentlessness, passion, and luck. Call of Duty didn't exist before I got into brand management - I was already in brand management. But by learning everything I could about the brands I was responsible for, and hard work, I grabbed the opportunity to work on Call of Duty when it appeared. I became the Senior Brand Manager for Call of Duty (UK & Rest of Europe). I knew we had massive goals for Call of Duty, and I wanted to make it a household name, but I didn't know how huge it could grow. I just worked hard and did my best to build the brand.” “I entered branding from a completely different industry. In previous roles I found myself solving for the problem that I was hired to solve but wanting to expand and make a difference. Part of our mission at my firm is only to partner with clients that are developing solutions that will drive benevolence and the greater good. The difference between what I was doing before and what I’m doing now is that I get to do what I’m passionate about every day!” \xa0 “I evolved into this path moving from business education to content, video editing, start-ups, etc. I have had my hands in almost every aspect of the business, so I enjoy the fact that I can work across teams and speak different languages. If you are considering this path, you need to like people, enjoy telling stories, and be willing to grind and be flexible.” “My biggest lesson learned in brand management and marketing overall is that the primary purpose of marketing within your organization is to support sales. If you don't connect the two, you cannot effectively grow your brand no matter how great your marketing executions might be. Much of brand management is about planning, coordination, and control. Therefore another tip is to position yourself confidently as the owner, guardian, an expert on your brand within your organization.” “Some of the best lessons I've picked up over the years are to first understand the customer on a very deep level. Give them a name and list their interests and how they spend their time. It sounds excessive, but it really helps marketing to focus on that specific user and think about how they would respond to your message.” “I’ve learned that this field is highly strategic and misunderstood. Branding means things to different clients and managing outcomes and expectations is critical to success. Drawing upon my experiences from different industries I’ve worked in, the end goal is no different: driving sales. Balancing strategy and creativity is what drives this business and it’s professionals.” “I have learned that a big part of brand development is actually very data-driven. Making decisions on what needs to be done next and how to move forward requires a review of progress and success. This is often best measured numerically, which requires a good set of goal metrics at the beginning of a project and target milestones throughout.” “I have learned that growth is everything. Think about your job as being the plane’s pilot rather than the air traffic controller. Everything you do should help your brand grow. Use centralized asset management for your brand. You would be surprised to learn how much time is wasted on ‘looking for things’. Simplify your branding toolbox. Make sure that your team can re-use each other's assets. Build a scalable system, and whatever you do, always ask yourself: can we make a template out of it for everyone? Is it applicable to more than one channel? A brand is a living thing. Keep your brand’s guidelines updated and easy to use. Nowadays, anyone in the company can be your marketer.” Having the title of brand manager is a big deal. You are the one responsible for making your brand a household name. There is no doubt that it’s a lofty job to take on, but if you start sharpening your skills and reflect on the advice shared from our brand experts, you will be well on your way to becoming the next successful brand manager! So, what are you waiting for? "], 14: ['There is a disconnect in customer service. Correction. There is a   disconnect in customer service. As the digital engagement landscape continues to rapidly evolve, one thing remains constant: customer service agents are the core of all support interactions. The popular adage   fits perfectly in this case because having the best people on board supposedly makes your business stronger.\xa0 But let’s say you hit the hiring jackpot and recruit the best candidates into your customer service team, you would naturally expect them to deliver the most exceptional experiences to your customers, right? Unfortunately, the reality is not that simple and is mostly definitely not an absolute yes. Creating positive experiences every time, across multiple channels, for your customers, doesn’t stop with efficiency and effectiveness. There’s a huge undeniable human component that’s missing from your customer interactions because agents don’t feel empowered to do their best work. And as we face the  , it’s a necessary reality check that every customer-facing organization today must take. Let’s take a look at some stats. According to Aspect,   is on average 30-50%, with next-gen agents likely to leave within a year, and 42% of service agents are unable to efficiently resolve customer issues due to disconnected systems, archaic user interfaces, and multiple applications. With a third of agents feeling unsatisfied in their work and over 40% of agents still feeling unempowered, there is a lot of work to be done to ensure that the customer-facing teams of most organizations get the attention they truly deserve.\xa0 The   realized way back in 1984 that the equation to ultimate customer happiness could only be solved if organizations found a way to understand the elusive X in it: AX – i.e. Agent Experience’ – a holistic view of how empowered, efficient, and effective service agents are. In an attempt to do this, the association started Customer Service Week to recognize front-line employees who deliver great service – and ever since – has been celebrated annually during the first week of October, giving organizations an opportunity to provide meaningful recognition to their customer service professionals. And rightfully so. The nature of customer service is evolving at an unbelievable pace. Customers are becoming increasingly comfortable with  .\xa0 The remaining live calls to contact centers are often more complicated to resolve, so providing consistent high-quality customer service depends on experienced, knowledgeable agents with proper training and necessary support. Failure to retain these talented employees can have significant repercussions: employee attrition can erode customer satisfaction while greatly increasing operating costs. Each new agent hire is estimated to cost the contact center $10,000 to $20,000 in training, direct recruiting costs, and lost productivity during ramp up.\xa0 Several studies have shown that agent positivity and commonality of experience play a big role in creating the experiences consumers want. In fact, empowered and engaged customer service agents rate their employers significantly higher than less empowered and less engaged agents in the important factors they say help them do their jobs, stay happy, and deliver better customer experiences.\xa0 The themes for this year’s National Customer Service Week couldn’t be more relevant to the current state of agent engagement. Here’s what they highlight.\xa0 Each of the above themes for the year are significantly important from the perspective of delivering great customer experiences but even more so from ensuring that the agent experience is front and center.\xa0 Agents are always on the frontline, talking to customers every single day, week after week thus naturally making them critical sources of insights towards understanding what customers expect from brands. Before a brand can understand its customers’ needs, it must look to listen to what its agents are recommending from their various conversations and exchanges with customers. The cumulative knowledge that agents provide can drastically improve the quality of your existing knowledge base and self-service outcomes. This not only boosts the overall information gathering process on customers but also builds the   towards the business for recognizing and acting on the feedback. As   (CX) technology continues to evolve, so will   - going beyond wearing headsets and following call scripts – as products get better, issues grow complex and conversations become smarter. On one hand, this is laying increasing pressure on agents to be experts in everything and on the other, several managers are warming up to the concept of  , allowing them to deliver greater workforce flexibility, maximize agent skills, lower staffing costs and boost customer satisfaction, all in one go. Although digital and self-serve technologies were expected to diminish the role of agents, they have actually increased it. Research shows that agents today are expected to be more versatile and multi-skilled, handling more transactions across multiple channels. With more routine inquiries being resolved through self-serve channels, agents are increasingly called upon to handle the most complex and demanding customer interactions – the ones with the biggest impact on revenue, customer experience,  , and brand. To achieve all of these tasks successfully, agents need a new generation of   tools. Agents must be provided with a unified integrated system that shows them a single consolidated view of all relevant information-customer profiles, buying history, interaction journeys - and enabled to leverage   such as messaging, presence, video, and screen-sharing, enabling quick access to subject matter experts throughout the enterprise. Most service agents today believe that handling moderately complex or complex questions/tasks will radically improve their skills and their value to the organization. So how do you make sure your   the time they have with customers? By reducing the amount of redundant and repetitive manual tasks and providing integrated technology solutions to optimize processes, streamline tasks, and eliminate your agents’ need to repeat questions or spend time looking up information across disconnected databases. Make the   at your business align with becoming an ambassador.\xa0 Customer service is only likely to become more complex in the coming years, meaning the expertise of longer-tenured service agents will be needed more than ever to consistently provide excellent customer experiences. The stress inherent in the customer service teams will always take a toll on efforts to retain high performers; that aspect of the job is highly unlikely to change. However, companies that strive to create a workplace where front-line employees and agents feel empowered, experience a strong sense of community and enjoy the time to connect with peers and supervisors will be rewarded with engaged employees who want to stay around longer. Success in this area will translate directly to happier service workforce, better experiences and hence loyal customers.\xa0 The best part is that most companies already have the necessary tools and knowledge to create happy ambassadors out of their agents: they just need to commit to using them in ways that matter the most to their service teams. And this will not happen with drawing all the focus and attention towards them just for one week in the year. It will have to be a conscious, collective and perpetual effort made every single week of every year.\xa0 ', "Providing great customer service is not a choice or luxury; it's a standard your customers expect. The customer experience can win you many new leads or make you go bankrupt depending on how it goes.\xa0 Caring about and addressing customers’ needs is crucial for success. However, if overwhelmed and covered with tasks, teams often struggle to deliver results and build relations with clients.\xa0 While some companies start implementing good practices, they still may make mistakes that can affect their brand recognition in a negative way.\xa0 Often, companies are lulled into a false sense of security by seeing decent business results, but there's no client relationships behind them, so in the long-term, the business may not be profitable. For example, selling products on Black Friday. Sales growth can skyrocket, but only for a moment if you don’t keep your new clients in the loop with your communication and spotless customer support.\xa0Easy come, easy go.\xa0 By now, you're probably wondering how can you spot and fix these issues quickly. So let's take a look at the most common customer service mistakes and what you can do to remedy them.\xa0 It is not always easy to understand what is in your customer’s mind. However, this can not be an excuse not to care about their insights and thoughts. There could be quite a few bottlenecks on your website that make your clients resign from further interaction or purchases. In the case of  , it is relatively often about errors in a payment section or a non-working mobile version. Tiny details can kill your conversion. In the case of some landing pages, a slight change of   buttons can determine the amount and quality of leads. Constant analysis of customer behavior has to be an element of your strategy. A lack of understanding customer behavior can cost you a lot of time and money and negatively affect your company’s workflow and cashflow. Reassure yourself that you check it on a regular basis. Use tools to analyze   and behaviors on your website.\xa0 Love it or hate it, but you need to be in constant contact with your clients. Wherever and whenever they write to you, they expect you to answer as soon as possible, and they won’t buy your explanation of why you answered back so late.\xa0 Clients hate changing platforms. If they message you, they are likely to be annoyed if you call them back. If they call you, they don’t want to wait for ages for your explanatory e-mails; they want an answer right here and right now. Of course, it won’t always be possible, but whenever you are able to, respond and act quickly. You can implement some solutions for making your customer service quicker or more precise. Configuring   can support narrowing issues and make it easier for the whole team responsible for customer support. Your clients can understand slower responses during weekends, but ignoring their requests for a couple of hours during working days can really put them off and make them choose your market rivals’ offer.\xa0 No customer service team will deliver great results if it consists of people who do not understand or like your business. The meaning of a dedicated customer service team is huge; they should strive to do their best job. If you don’t take care of  or do it too quickly, you put your business at risk, as people may not be trained enough and, therefore, they may not be helpful for your clients.  not only helps your employees, but it also helps you verify if you have chosen the best people for your business. While you shouldn’t write anyone off too soon, having some ideas of potential performance is always warmly welcomed.\xa0 Sometimes, it can not be about staff training, but staff size. Hiring too many people, especially at the beginning of your business journey, can impact your cash flow. You can be sure that any peaks of traffic will be handled quickly and clients do not wait for too long. However, usually the problem is the other way around. You may regard understaffing as the perfect way to save some budget, but it can drag your business down pretty quickly. If there is nobody to handle client requests and complaints, it is extremely likely that you’ll start losing clients. Your competition does not sleep.\xa0 Data is all around us. What you need to do is to pick it and get into deep analysis. The more data you have, the better service you can offer. On a smaller scale, you may not see much difference, but when you have thousands of customers all over the world, you need to optimize some processes. You need to have data about your clients and your team performance at your constant disposal in order to identify potential problems that both your customers and team members can encounter.\xa0 Getting high-quality data can be really difficult, but not if you use the right tools. If your customer service department heavily relies on inbound or outbound calls, you may want to do the most of call tracking and call statistics to figure out whether your team works well or what areas can be improved.\xa0 Need some help in this department? Find the   to get your feet off the ground.\xa0 If, within the same call center, you need to deal with thousands of callers or calls each day, knowing more about them can save you a lot of time spent on each call. For example, a call from a client who is not satisfied with their order can be managed easier if the customer service employee can access information about that order without looking for ages. Thanks to   and various integrations, support can be easier, more precise, and much quicker. Similar rules apply to some outbound call centers. If you had a potential lead on the list, it would be worth knowing why they hadn’t converted earlier or whether they resigned from further cooperation.\xa0 You are not a magician; you probably can’t make all of your clients’ wishes come true with a magic wand. However, you should take each and every of these wishes seriously, as they may address features your products or services lack. If this repeats, which means that you are getting more messages of this type, you should definitely think about introducing such a feature or improve the option. Customer feedback is the integral element of improvements, and ignoring it can cost you a lot. By taking customer feedback seriously, you are showing your clients that their opinions matter and that you want to make the products or services answer their needs and requirements. Your customers may feel appreciated and show bigger loyalty to your brand, or even become brand ambassadors.\xa0 You don’t have to be a master of procedures and document every 10 seconds of your businesses' existence. However, you need to make and implement some procedures within your customer service team.\xa0 This is a mistake made by both customer service and sales teams.\xa0 Being busy with tasks and dealing with requests, the members of such teams have no time - or will - to build any further relations with clients. No one says to befriend every client, but finding out how they are doing after an order, message, or complaint help build higher brand awareness and relations on the line between the client and the brand. If your team has no time or willingness of doing so, recognize what the reasons of this approach are and try to work on some solutions. Sometimes, you can even go   to maximize the potential effects. For example, if your client calls you with some issues, and you quickly solve them, you may ask the client about making a review of the customer support via text message or email. Many brands are increasingly using an   for such a purpose.\xa0 The   you offer should be flawless, no doubt about it. You should be always willing to work on it, even if you think you can’t possibly offer anything extra or new. If your customer service promises the world over the phone to your clients, but then does not deliver on the arrangements, the customer experience definitely is not consistent and your customers can be confused, being attracted by one branch of your customer service and disappointed by another one.\xa0 9. Lack of tools Be sure that your team has useful tools, including call center management software or a platform for internal communication and secure file storing. You may also want to introduce an intuitive CRM in your organization to gather even more corresponding data. If you read through the list above and were able to comfortably wipe the sweat off your brow, congratulations! You're in the clear. Still, that doesn't mean you should stop striving for perfection. You can always do better both for your clients and potential customers.\xa0 ", "How long will it take your B2B SaaS startup to grow to 10,000 customers? Whatever your estimates are, you probably want it to happen as quickly as possible. However, fast growth can either make your startup dreams come true or ruin your company. It depends on how well you plan for scale. Fast growth is a big challenge. Your customer support team will be the first to face hurdles when the number of customers starts growing exponentially. At the early stage, every time you see your support team struggling to cope with the volume of requests, you’ll hire new people. But this can be only a temporary solution. What ways to improve customer service will you choose next? Let’s look at  , a vendor of  . It has transformed from a startup into a self-sustaining 10000-customer company for five years. During this time, Poster’s customer support team has passed through several major transformations. Now, Poster has 52 people working in customer service, helping the restaurant industry professionals in 80 countries, and handling 25,000 requests per month. Alexander Buchkov, Head of Customer Support at Poster, shares his company’s experience on scaling their support department and maintaining high standards of customer service at different stages of growth. Read the post to get some ideas on how to keep the efficiency of your operations in sync with the growth, structure your support department, and motivate employees. At an early stage, when Poster acquired its first clients, the company had a slowly growing support team led by one manager. Every member of the team worked as a personal account manager for a group of customers. Everybody in the team had similar responsibilities and communicated with customers in live chat, on the phone, and through email. Being responsible for 50 to 200 restaurants each, account managers were able to cope with reactive and proactive tasks: Our account managers had multi-functional skills and were interchangeable. Each of them would onboard their clients and would assist any other customers when they needed to solve urgent problems. As the account managers' workload increased, we decided to automate part of their work and launched an automatic customer onboarding campaign. We set up triggered messages in the product interface to describe Poster’s features and explain how customers can benefit from using them. To improve our management processes we divided our customer support department into three independent teams. Each team had a team lead, who started to supervise the work of their subordinates, train newcomers, help to resolve difficult tasks and give feedback. This allowed Head of Customer Support to delegate a substantial part of operational tasks to team leads and release time for strategic decision making. We started developing a new team culture, encourage team building activities, and let the teams compete with each other. We measured seconds before our support representatives pick up the phone, their response time in chat, churn rate, etc. and rewarded the winner-team every quarter. In three months after the introduction of the new team structure and the launch of the competition, we’ve got a substantial improvement by all the key metrics. Our customer support has leveled up. However, as the number of customers continued to grow we were looking for ideas for improving customer service through better operational efficiency. We analyzed the nature of the questions we were getting via different communication channels. It appeared that people prefer to ask quick how-to questions in the live chat and to call when they require urgent help or have a more difficult question. We decided to create a dedicated team to   to filter out all the quick how-to questions and scale this communication channel. As the dedicated live chat support team covered a huge part of reactive work, the teams that supported customers by phone also improved their performance. The closer we approached the 10,000 customer benchmark, the better we realized that our teams require one more quality upgrade. Seeing the benefits from the creation of a dedicated online chat support team, we were looking for ways to further our employee specialization. At first, we wanted to subdivide our department into customer success and customer support to let the former focus on proactive work and let the latter shoulder reactive work. However, knowing about the pitfalls of dividing the work with one customer between different departments we declined the idea. Alternatively, we decided to create  consisting of:\xa0 The constant knowledge exchange within a cross-functional team helps every member grow professionally. The members of one team with different specialization contribute their expertise to reach common goals. A lot of companies use the   metric to gauge customers' satisfaction. An NPS survey allows estimating by the scale from -100 to 100 how willing your customers are to recommend your product or service to others. Our customer success representatives also use NPS, however, we don't rely completely on it. Customers replies are usually affected by the emotions they have during the NPS survey. That's why the survey results may not even correlate with the churn rate. To get a better idea about how useful is Poster to our clients we decided to measure  . We believe it is a more reliable metric than NPS because:\xa0 As a one-size-fits-all framework for customer health scores doesn’t exist, we calculate customer health score by own formula that takes into account three metrics that we consider valuable. Based on customer health score and NPS our customer success team prioritizes their work. Currently, their main goal is to improve the level of satisfaction with our product for the customers who have below average scores. Poster’s customer health framework has worked since January 2019 and it is a work in progress. And we are thinking about new upgrades for our customer support department to make it prepared to further   growth. Currently we can see that our customer service turns users into brand advocates, which proves its efficiency. About 60% of new users sign up to Poster on our loyal customers’ recommendation.\xa0 "], 49: ['Creating a LinkedIn company page is a rite of passage for many business owners.

You can choose any image you\'d like as your banner image. Many brands choose to change their banner images periodically to promote their current marketing campaigns. LinkedIn recommends that all cover photos are displayed at  Visitors to your page won\'t be impressed if they notice that your company rarely shares content on your profile. The good news is that you don\'t have to dedicate all new resources towards creating content solely for your LinkedIn page. Think of your company profile as just another channel through which you can share company news, upcoming events, webinars, and blog posts. This gives you an opportunity to engage with your LinkedIn audience and give them a glimpse into happenings at your company. It\'s important to note that LinkedIn allows you to set more than one person as an administrator of your company page. This is vital in the event that the original admin is on vacation, leaves the company, or is otherwise unable to access the page. By giving access to multiple team members, you can ensure that your page will always have someone managing it effectively. ', 'Everything is online nowadays – including our professional lives. While it may seem like LinkedIn is only for job seekers, the social network has also proven to be a powerful tool for salespeople, especially across the B2B landscape. Now more than ever, prospects are hit with sales pitches everywhere they turn – meaning it’s going to take a lot more than a traditional cold email to get someone’s attention. LinkedIn is the world’s most popular social network for business professionals – it’s more likely than not that the majority of your prospects have a profile and  . If you’re continuously running into roadblocks with traditional prospecting methods, it might be time to invest more thought into leveraging LinkedIn as a sales resource. In this article, we lay out the top seven ways LinkedIn can help you break through the noise and prospect successfully. Much like a traditional social network, LinkedIn allows you to connect and establish relationships with other users. In this case, these users happen to be prospective buyers. While it may seem as simple as sending a friend request, there’s a lot more that goes into turning your connections into actual paying customers. The trick to leveraging LinkedIn as an effective selling platform is knowing all of its capabilities and how to use them to your advantage. Let’s get started. One of the first rules of selling is making a good first impression on your prospective customers. On LinkedIn, first impressions are formed based on your profile. Your profile page should be a direct reflection of your professional brand. As a sales rep, it’s important to highlight your own career achievements as well as provide information about the company you work for and the product or service you sell. The goal is to come off as approachable, authentic, and credible. The best part is that you don’t have to make any drastic changes to your page, just some small tweaks here and there. Here are a few best practices to follow when optimizing your profile for selling: This should be a no-brainer. By adding a professional picture, your profile becomes more personal and it helps people put a face to the name. This is what prospects will see when you appear in search results and at the very top of your profile page. You want your connections to know who you are and what you do. Don’t just put your job title in this section. You want to stand out, not blend in. Instead, use a headline that is more creative and descriptive. For example, if you sell B2B accounting software and target a small business audience, a compelling headline could be, “I help small businesses manage their finances more effectively.” Keep it short and simple. The most important thing to remember when it comes to your LinkedIn profile summary is to be authentic and genuine. People buy from people that they like and relate to. You should take this opportunity to show who you are and what you value. Don’t hesitate to be creative and share a personal narrative – if that’s your thing. If you prefer to keep things professional, share a bit about your background and why the solution you sell is meaningful to you. If you’re comfortable giving out your work email address, this is the spot to do it. Prospects who want to get in touch will appreciate that you’re easy to get a hold of. A key factor during the sales process is building trust. While it may seem simple, taking the step to include a list of skills and get endorsements from your connections will instantly boost your credibility and make you more trustworthy in the eyes of the people you’re selling to.  Don’t have an account yet? Check out our beginner’s guide on   to learn how to set up your profile, add experience, and start growing your network. LinkedIn allows you to “follow” organizations and be notified of company updates and changes. To avoid cluttering your feed, compile a list of only your top target accounts to follow. You want to stay on top of any big company updates and changes as these are usually good opportunities to reach out to your prospects at those companies. For example, let’s say one of your top prospects works at a company that just shared a post about receiving a new round of venture capital funding. This is a great excuse to reach out to your contact, congratulate them on the funding, and see if it makes sense to connect. As previously mentioned, LinkedIn is an incredibly useful platform for establishing your professional brand and building credibility among your colleagues and peers. If you’re new to personal branding, creating original LinkedIn content is a great place to start. Do research to find topics that your prospective customers care about. Write on those topics and don’t be afraid to share your own personal expertise. If you prefer a more visual medium, videos are an equally effective option. Once your content is published, remember to promote it as well as engage with other articles or videos that you see being shared among your network. LinkedIn groups are a great resource for getting more involved in your industry, sharing your expertise, and connecting with potential buyers. When deciding which groups to join, put yourself in the shoes of your prospects: what do they care about? For instance, if your target audience is HR decision-makers, aim to join groups focused on human resources and talent management. Once you find the right groups to join, be sure to engage in dialogue with others, establish your credibility, and start building relationships. Although this method will take some time to generate results, your efforts will pay off in the long run once your pipeline is filled with highly-quality leads. When it comes to using LinkedIn’s direct message feature, InMail, tread with caution. You might be tempted to InMail your prospects directly, but if they’re not responding to your emails and phone calls, it’s unlikely that they will respond now. With that in mind, it   possible to use InMail for successful prospecting, as long as you’re thoughtful about it. On LinkedIn, you have a unique opportunity to leverage your professional network in a way that’s more authentic than email. A prospect can go right to your profile and see what mutual connections you have. Use this to your advantage. When reaching out, don’t hesitate to call out a mutual connection if it makes sense within the context of your message. This can be as simple as saying: “ ” Remember to always structure your sales outreach in a way that puts the prospect at the center of your message. This goes for any form of cold outreach, but especially on LinkedIn InMail. Use an InMail as an opportunity to provide even more value and stray away from using “I” too many times. The focus of your message needs to be on what you can do to help solve a prospective customer’s problem, not about why they should buy from you. Nowadays, people’s LinkedIn messages are becoming just as crowded as their email inboxes. If you want to amplify your message and make your InMail stand out, it’s a good idea to personalize your outreach using information from the prospect’s profile. It shows you’ve done your research. After you’ve put in the time and effort to build relationships with your connections, there may come a time when you want to take conversations off the platform. LinkedIn allows you to export any contact, regardless of whether or not you’re connected to them. Follow these steps to learn how to export your LinkedIn contacts: 1. At the top of your homepage, click “ ” underneath your profile picture 2. From the drop-down menu, select “ ” 3. Under the privacy tab, click on “ 4. Scroll to the option that reads “ and select  ” 5. Under the “ ” option, check the box for “ ” 6. Click “ ” From here, you will receive an email with a download link to a ZIP file that will allow you to export your list of LinkedIn connections. Now that you have a way to access your connections outside of LinkedIn, you’re free to nurture these relationships as you see fit. Just remember to always be tactful in your sales approach. All of the tips outlined in this article are examples of social selling – a buzzword used to describe the idea of using social media to sell to prospects. To help guide your social selling efforts, LinkedIn launched its   (SSI) feature that assigns a score to every user’s profile. This score is calculated based on four main metrics: Your SSI score is updated daily and shows your progress week over week. The SSI dashboard will also show you how you rank against people in your industry. B2B is evolving, so the way you sell to prospects needs to, too. LinkedIn may have started primarily as a platform for business and job seekers, but it’s proven to be a powerful resource for many different types of use cases – including for salespeople. With these tips in mind, you’re ready to leverage LinkedIn to its fullest potential. ', "LinkedIn is known for being one of the best places to connect with business professionals.

Admittedly, I don’t know what “it” is, and I can’t say with any speck of certainty that anybody, regardless of age, actually says that. Either way, Instagram’s introduction of Instagram Direct, the photo-sharing platform’s direct messaging feature, was an exciting new release when it launched in 2013. Instagram was always a public-facing platform. To interact with other accounts, users had to like or comment on their posts. When Instagram Direct was introduced, users who followed each other were able to send private, one-to-one messages for the first time. Let’s get started! So now that we have the DM definition, we can dive a bit deeper into how to send a message on Instagram and why the feature was introduced.\xa0 The video above accompanied Systrom’s announcement and briefly explored the new feature's main functionalities. Interestingly, this announcement came shortly after Instagram was acquired by Facebook, a platform that launched its private messenger back in 2008. In 2013, private   messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger were continuing to dominate (with the latter already seeing nearly 200 million monthly active users). Even more importantly,  , the multimedia messaging app, was quickly gaining traction. Introducing a direct messaging feature was a smart (and maybe even  ) move by Instagram. Through Instagram Direct, users can send photos or videos that they take (or upload from their phone’s photo library), posts they saw in the feed, disappearing photos and videos (think Snapchat),   user’s Instagram stories, hashtags, and location pages. Instagram also recently added a green dot next to an Instagram user’s profile picture that indicates when they’re logged on to Instagram and available to chat. An Instagram DM can be sent to one person, or, up to 32 people in a group chat! (If you want to share private Instagram stories with more than 32 people, consider making an   list.) As of 2018, users can use Instagram direct messaging to video chat with just one person or a group of up to four different people. This new feature works similar to FaceTime or Google Hangout, with users able to video chat anyone with whom they have a direct message thread open. Today, Instagram Direct has evolved to be a valuable form of  . Organizations with an   can use the tool to offer  , and users can use the tool to connect with their favorite brands. Of course, it would be unfair to tell you about all of these exciting features without telling you how to use them! These step-by-step instructions will give you all of the information you need to start chatting with your friends and followers via Instagram DM. As mentioned above, there are plenty of ways to DM on Instagram. That said, there are definitely two methods you’re more likely to use than others.

Or, maybe you ran into an old college acquaintance while running errands and want to reach out, but you forgot to exchange phone numbers. Whatever your reasoning may be, sending a chat, picture, or video by Instagram DM can be a great way to reach people! Luckily, this is a simple process consisting of just a few steps. This first step is easy – and if you’re anything like me, something you already do every single day. Grab your phone, open up your Instagram app, and log in to your account. As a heads up, our instructions and screenshots refer to sending an Instagram DM from an iPhone. However, the process should look similar (if not identical) on Android devices. When you tap on the paper airplane button or swipe left, you’ll be brought to the screen from which you’ll send your DM. If you have existing conversations (or if you’ve ever been sent a DM before), they’ll appear on this screen. To send a new message, tap the plus sign in the top right corner. This will bring you to the screen where you select the person (or persons) to whom you’d like to send the message. Instagram will pull up a list of suggested accounts to which you may want to send your direct message. If you don’t see your intended recipient, use the search bar at the top of the screen to find them, searching by either their username   full name. When you’ve selected your recipient, click “Next” in the top right corner. To send a chat, type your message and click send. To   a new picture or video to send, tap the camera button to the left of the chat-box. If you’ve posted an Instagram story before, this screen should look familiar! You can take a picture or video as normal, or take advantage of some of Instagram’s fun features like Boomerangs, filters, and more. \xa0 Select the way you would like your picture or video to appear, and hit send! To send a picture or video from your photo library, tap the button to the right of your chat-box. This button looks like a landscape scene. This will pull up your phone’s camera roll, from which you can select a photo or video. Once you select your image, click send.

From there, you can continue chatting back and forth, or send additional content. Now that Instagram is littered with meme accounts (I’m not complaining), it’s a pretty regular occurrence to see something in your feed that makes you laugh out loud. And what’s better than laughing alone? Laughing with friends, of course! Luckily, Instagram makes it easy to send posts directly from the feed to your friends and followers. The original poster will   know that you sent their Instagram post, nor will the messages appear in the Instagram feed, search, or your profile. However, keep in mind that if the original poster has a  , your recipient won’t be able to see the post unless they follow the account that posted it. If the original poster has a   Instagram profile, then you’re good to go! Now, here’s how to send a post directly from your Instagram feed. We’ll skip the steps that require opening Instagram and logging in – if you’ve found something you want to share, we can safely assume you’ve done that already! When you tap on the paper plane image below the image you want to share, Instagram will pull up a list of your existing conversations. If you don’t see your intended recipient(s), simply use the search bar to find their account and select their Instagram handle from the list. After you select your recipient, you can opt to type a message that will send along with the post. Consider including a message that provides more context on the image or explains why the post made you think of this particular person. Instagram DMs are a great way to connect with friends and family, so take advantage of the opportunity to include a personalized message!  If your recipient can’t see the post, no need for them to follow the account! Simply   or iPhone and send the screenshot via DM using the first set of instructions. Hopefully, this post has taught you exactly how to DM on Instagram.

The   now allows personal and Instagram business pages to add alt text to photos, both new and those that have already been uploaded, in an effort to improve accessibility. Users are now able to add custom alt text that will be automatically read by screen readers, or other  programs that are often used to assist individuals with visual impairments or low vision. If you’re a regular user of Instagram, either on a personal level or as part of your   plan you might have noticed that many users have been manually adding their own sub-captions to their photos to cater to their visually impaired followers. Now, it’s even easier to have an inclusive brand or experience on Instagram. It\'s simple to add alt text to your Instagram photos. 1. Open the Instagram mobile app and click the center bottom button to add a photo. 2. Select your photo and click "next" 3. Apply the filters of your choice, then click "next" to end at the caption page. Click "advanced settings" 4. At the bottom, click "write alt text" 5. Add in your alt text, then hit "done" Great! Now you\'ve added alt text to your newly posted Instagram photo. 1. Select the photo you wish you add Instagram alt text to, then click the three small horizontal dots at the top right corner of the page 2. Choose "edit" from the menu that pops up 3. Click "add alt text" in the lower right corner of your photo 4.\xa0 Instagram alt text captions serve the primary purpose of increasing accessibility for Instagram users who are visually impaired or have low vision. The World Health Organization estimates that 285 million people worldwide are considered visually impaired, with 246 million of those having low vision and the remaining 39 million considered blind. That\'s an enormous percentage of the world that may struggle to see what\'s being posted on various corners of the internet. Aside from the ethical reasons you (hopefully) want to make the world a more accessible place, if you\'re a business owner or utilize  , you don\'t want to alienate any portion of your customer base with ignorance. On the contrary, brands who prioritize accessibility are opening themselves up to an even larger group of customers. Think of your Instagram alt text captions as a descriptor of what\'s happening in the photo. For example, in my gelato photo, my actual caption doesn\'t really give that much information - it does allude to the fact that it\'s gelato and that the photo was taken in Italy, but not much more than that. If I was writing an Instagram alt text caption, I would say something more along the lines of, "I\'m holding a two-scoop gelato cone up against the background of the ancient city of Matera, Italy. The sky is blue, and it contrasts with the gelato that is garnished with a piece of waffle cone. My nails are painted purple and the gelato is melting." That\'s a much more visceral description that would help someone who was visually impaired to not only get an idea of what\'s happening in the photo, but also get a sense of my brand.\xa0 '], 11: ['The sales funnel is a point of contention for a lot of marketers. This is partly because there are multiple stages of the   that require different messaging and partly because the exact route a customer takes can dramatically vary from brand to brand. The most important thing to remember is that prospects have different needs at  . For example, a prospect who has just been introduced to your brand has different needs than a prospect who’s hand is hovering over the “buy” button. This also means that different types of content work best at different points throughout the sales funnel. When it comes to video – one of the most effective content mediums - it’s important to get it right if you want to increase sales. Here’s how to use video when it matters the most: at the vital end stage of your funnel. Content comes in all shapes and sizes, so why should you be using video at the end of your funnel? Or perhaps the most important question to ask is: what makes it so powerful? Video is more engaging than text-based content. Before you go rushing to create video content, there are a few things you need to think about first. It’s a common misconception that you need a fully-functioning camera crew and professional editing suite to create videos. Instead, you’ve got everything you need in your pocket. Most smartphones have high-quality, built-in cameras that you can record footage on, and there are plenty of editing apps for post-production tweaks and animations. You can produce the best video in the world, but if it doesn’t tackle the wants and needs of your customers, you’re going to struggle to scrape any conversions. This is why it’s important to think about the key things your customers need just before they hit buy. For a lot of brands, this is testimonials, customer stories, and use cases that they can apply to their own business. Prospects will enter and go through your funnel in a variety of different ways, which is why you need to think about where you’re going to put your videos once you’ve created them. Again, this will be determined by the route your customers usually take. For example, if they tend to find you through social media and come directly to your product pages to buy, you might want to incorporate product videos on those pages. Alternatively, if your customers keep returning to your homepage while they weigh their options, you might want to add a video there. The following ideas for how you can use video content at the   are geared toward increasing engagement and converting more customers. Testimonials should be used to prove the value of your product or service to potential customers, and to highlight customers who truly respect your brand and let the world know their feelings. Turn your testimonials into videos to make them more engaging and to show off a more human side to your brand.\xa0 Like with testimonials, potential buyers like to see how you’ve helped previous customers. This is why case study videos can be so effective. Not only can they show customer emotion, but they also provide proof of potential use cases that builds trust.\xa0 Imagine someone is hovering over the buy button on your latest product but they’re hesitant to pull the trigger because they’re not sure if it will fit with their unique needs and they’re not 100% sure how it will work for them. Now imagine they had a video tutorial of use cases where you run through how the product is used and leave them with no objections. This is precisely the effect video tutorials can have, particularly for consumers at the very bottom of the sales funnel.\xa0 The sale is just the start of your relationship with a new customer. From there, it’s a process of nurturing them so they can get the most out of your product and hopefully come back for more or at least recommend you to their friends and colleagues. Videos at the onboarding stage can be incredibly useful for showing customers how to interact with and use your products as well as introducing your brand to them in more detail. Video is a powerful addition to your sales funnel, particularly if you use it in the right place at the right time. The tactics highlighted in this post work to build engagement, prove to prospects that they can trust you, and ultimately increase sales.\xa0 ', 'YouTube remains one of the top video-sharing platforms in 2020.\xa0 And honestly, there are no signs of it wavering anytime soon. YouTube still has massive pull as a video-sharing platform despite competitors ( , anyone?) joining their ranks. In fact, according to YouTube, they have   on the platform every month.\xa0That’s a lot of users. But for YouTube creators, that means there’s a ton of competition. If you’re a YouTube creator and want your content to stand out from the pack, the first thing you need to do, aside from producing useful and entertaining videos of course, is to optimize your videos (SEO) from the ground up.\xa0In this step-by-step guide, we’ll show you changes you can implement to perform better on YouTube. Keyword research is an uncomplicated place to start.\xa0Researching keywords will not only give you a better idea of what words and phrases people use when they search for videos, but it will also help ensure your video will is positioned to get in front of the right audiences. In short, it’s pretty vital. By adding keywords in your titles, descriptions, and tags you’ll have a better shot at showing up in the top search results. Luckily, there are a few straightforward and easy ways you can do this without breaking your back (or the bank). YouTube Suggestions are prompts that appear as you type in a search query. For example, typing in "how to cook" will reveal several suggestions.\xa0 These suggestions are indicative of the content people are interested in and likely to search for. Type your target keyword into the YouTube search bar. You might be surprised by some of the topics that pop up. In the example below, you can see how it would be easy to come up with multiple future videos related to a juice cleanse, if that’s your thing.\xa0 Pretty painless, right? YouTube keyword research tools are pretty straight forward. If you want a direct readout of search volume data, there’s no better way to go. There are both free and paid options available.   is particularly useful. Or if you want a browser extension, you could consider an option like  . Using the approaches listed above, you should be able to narrow down the searcher’s intent – another critical component to any and all keyword research.\xa0Ask what information is a user searching for when they type X into a search bar.\xa0Are they looking for tutorials, recommendations, or product reviews? What’s grabbing a viewers attention? Answering these questions will allow you to determine what type of content you should create to provide exactly what users are looking for. That’ll mean more and longer views, and then better exposure in the YouTube search results! Now that you’re able to determine popular videos and keywords, you’re now ready for the next step: creating content. That’s easier said than done. We all know creating content can be time-consuming.\xa0Fortunately, there are great ways to streamline the filming process, including storyboarding. Storyboarding is a process wherein you plot and sketch the most important aspects of your video. It looks kind of like a comic strip, which kind of makes it 5 times more fun. Each frame is supposed to display roughly what’s happening, what’s being said, and by whom. Creating an engaging intro can be challenging.\xa0Luckily, the App method can help. The APP method was introduced by Brian Dean, an online marketer. It’s a writing technique that allows you to create the most compelling introductions.\xa0And yes, it also works for YouTube videos. APP stands for Agree, Promise, and Preview. Using the APP method to come up with video introductions that will leave your audience wanting more. Improving your audience retention and watch time is key. Let’s be blunt: editing can make or break a video.\xa0If you’re an avid YouTube watcher, then you’ve seen it countless times. There’s another level of engagement involved with edits, close ups, and jump cuts.\xa0Really, it’s a deciding factor between a good video and a great one. Sometimes, amateur content creators make the mistake of uploading their videos as shot, and this can be a big mistake. Some videos tend to be a little bland, especially if you’re using the talking head format (where you sit in front of a camera and talk directly to the audience).\xa0 To make your videos more appealing, try adding video editing techniques like adding jump cuts or transitions. You can also add graphics. During filming, add props that talents can interact with. As is the case with  , optimizing a few key areas of your YouTube video posts to include your targeted keywords is an important step.Take the results of your keyword research, and incorporate them here. Keep in mind however, that I’m not telling you to just stuff some keywords in there without a second thought.\xa0Keywords should always be used naturally, and read easily with the rest of the text on a page. Believe it or not, that’s all you need to worry about regarding on-page optimization for YouTube videos.\xa0 Beyond your video content and on-page optimization, you can make your videos even more helpful for your viewers with the tips and tricks listed below. If viewers like the video you’ve posted, there’s a good chance that they’ll want to see more like it. Creating a CTA on the end screen can help. Plus, it makes it easier for users to find similar content, while encouraging them to stay on your channel. The end screen is where you can promote videos that are doing well on your channel. You can even put an entire playlist if you’d like. YouTube cards are similar to end screen videos, only turned up to 11. It’ll show a moving preview of the attached video at the end of the current one.\xa0But it can actually do even more than just promote your other videos. You can enable YouTube Cards by going to your YouTube Video Manager settings. While YouTube is a pretty advanced platform, it still helps if you provide closed captioning. That’ll ensure that the search engine itself is able to understand the entire context of each of your videos, rather than strictly relying on the title and description. It’s an easy and user-friendly way to help increase your page views, search traffic, search rank, and engagement.\xa0For more info on this, check out YouTube’s dedicated page that explains how to  to your content. So you’ve done your research, created engaging content and optimized it for both users and YouTube search.\xa0Now it’s time to get proactive about generating exposure and garnering some views. It may take some time before your videos get any traction, especially if you\'re just starting out. But there are a few ways you can help speed along the process.\xa0 Most YouTubers today create custom thumbnails. These are a smart investment of your time, not only because you’ll get to completely control the presentation of the video pre-viewing, but also because you can start to create a clear style/brand for all of the content on your channel.\xa0 If you have comments enabled, you should make sure to engage with commenters sooner rather than later. It’s great for generating a sense of community and getting viewers to come back to your channel for you. Once in a while, it might be beneficial to do a Q&A session with your subscribers. It’ll give you a chance to grant them a behind-the-scenes peek at some of their favorite content, or just get to know your viewers better.\xa0 This may go without saying, but it’s a good idea to share your YouTube videos on social media platforms. It\'s good for engagement and added visibility, and it should even net you some extra views.\xa0 If you already have an email list, don’t forget you can promote new video content to your subscribers in most cases. You could go a step further and add a link to your YouTube channel in your email signature as well.\xa0 While   can be prohibitive for many entrepreneurs, YouTube creators will fortunately rarely need to hire outside help.\xa0As you can probably gather from the above, a lot of what YouTube SEO boils down to is just being smart about how you plan, create, and promote your video content. Now more than ever, search results are geared towards providing users with the most relevant and useful content possible. That means, your optimization will need to start before you even press record. t’s ultimately worth the effort.\xa0 Follow the steps above and you’ll be well on your way to earning more subscribers and showing up more prominently in YouTube search results!\xa0 ', "Word on the street is that YouTube has a new look.

"], 1: ["If you didn’t even know there were different types of apps, you’ve come to the right place. , but what kind of app should it be? That depends largely on its primary function and the user base you're targeting, among other things. Looking for something in particular? Feel free to skip ahead\xa0to the following sections: Let’s clear up the confusion here. There are actually three main types of apps:  ,  , and  . The latter two are both considered mobile apps. Let’s dive deeper into the defining characteristics of each, cover the pros and cons of web and mobile apps, and include some examples.\xa0 Think of web apps as the “one size fits all” version of apps. It usually fits okay, but rarely as well as it could. Web apps are also referred to as web-fronted apps or web-based apps. However, it’s important to clarify that a   is not the same as a mobile website.\xa0 Non-native tools were intentionally created to avoid writing code twice, as well as to give more developers the ability to make apps. Web apps are created with common programming languages such as HTML and CSS because they run in a browser similar to the way a website does. An emerging trend, progressive web apps (PWAs) take advantage of some recent browser advancements to allow web apps to act more like mobile apps. However, operating system support and functionality is still limited when compared to true mobile apps. The majority of apps on your phone are mobile apps. You can install them to your device from a marketplace, such as the App Store or Google Play Store. There are two kinds of mobile apps: native and hybrid. The terms “mobile app” and “native app” are often used interchangeably, and that’s because   the mobile app being referred to is a native mobile app.\xa0 Native mobile apps are built in platform-specific languages. Native app developers use   or Objective-C for iOS apps,   or C++ for Android apps and C# for Windows Phone apps. Yes, that means if you want your   to be available for download on Android and iOS devices, you’ll need to build multiple versions that, most likely, won’t have identical user interfaces. (image by  ) You guessed it—hybrid apps combine the best of both web and native apps. Technically a kind of mobile app, a hybrid app is installed like a native app, but when you run it, it functions as a web app using a platform’s WebView. (WebView is kind of a mini web browser that can be configured to run fullscreen.) Hybrid apps are also built specifically for the operating system, and can therefore also access device capabilities like a native app. However, similar to web apps, hybrid apps are written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but are then packaged for different platforms. The short answer is it depends. Can you get by with a “fits all” app, or should you look for something that fits your specifications a little better? It’s based on the occasion. Think about what features are most important to you, your company goals, and/or the app’s main function. If your app is simply an interactive resource for additional information or only needs internet access to provide a satisfactory user experience ( ), a web app might be the way to go. Progressive web apps are a good fix for companies trying to build better mobile usability than what is currently offered via their mobile site. Here’s what Lancȏme’s web app looks like in the Google Chrome mobile browser. Other web app examples If your app will need access to the device’s camera or GPS, you should highly consider making a native mobile app. While a hybrid mobile app does allow you to utilize some of these features, it probably won’t be the best experience for your user. Pokémon Go is a native app, utilizing both the camera and GPS functions of the smart device, combined with\xa0 . Other native app examples: While hybrid mobile apps aren’t as common as web or native apps, the list of companies using them might surprise you. In certain circumstances, web apps are converted to hybrid mobile apps in order to take have some native-like advantages, including an app marketplace listing. Uber is a hybrid app that really has the look and feel of a native app, but for the most part it runs on m.uber.com using a WebView.\xa0 \xa0Other hybrid app examples: There are many factors to consider when deciding which type of app is best for your business. Whether you choose to build a web app, native app or hybrid app, it’s important to keep your users top of mind to provide the most value and best experience possible. ", 'There’s a time and a place for everything. There’s also something to be said about doing your research and learning from others successes, and sometimes their mistakes, before starting your next big app project. When it comes to choosing the best programming language, it can largely depend on the type of app you’re planning to build. For example, if you’re developing a 3D game, chances are you’ll want to use  . In short, before choosing your tools, remember that there are different options available for different types of apps. We asked the experts for their advice about the best app programming languages. Let’s just say, it got technical.\xa0 These were the 6 best app programming languages: “I\'ve used Swift to create dozens of apps for iOS. Swift\'s syntax is simple but powerful, with lots of syntactic sugar that makes coding iOS apps a breeze. Swift\'s safety features stand out, such as optionals, because they help you code more productively with less bugs. It\'s the go-to language for building a new app for Apple platforms, and I recommend it for any production-level app. The latest version of the programming language, Swift 5, has matured a lot and become more stable. The programming language itself is actively being developed, with an engaged open-source community. For me, being part of that community makes Swift more than just a tool.” “The advantage of using Swift is that it has built-in functionality to ensure that apps are robust, current, and optimized for Apple devices. Swift syntax is clean, easy to read, and simple to maintain. Plus, memory is managed automatically. I recommend Swift for its elegance, safety, and ease of use.” “With 5 years of experience and trying many different languages and tools, my favorite must be Swift. XCode is the integrated development environment (IDE) swift is programmed in providing suggestions in code and showing you how to fix errors in real time helping you learn along the way. Swift seems to incorporate the best from every language before it - easy syntax, null objects with quick null checks, and beautifully designed callbacks.” “I prefer it to Kotlin or Swift because I find it easier to read and use in general, especially when debugging. While Kotlin and Swift might use fewer lines of code, the extra lines of code in Java become extremely beneficial when it comes to debugging an issue. When it comes to deciding which language to use, a lot of that decision rides on which platform you’re building your app for. For iOS, Objective-C and Swift are the most popular languages to use and for Android, Java or Kotlin are the way to go.” “I love Python for apps, because it\'s so easy to learn. Even a marketer like me, who\'s not a developer, can understand Python! If you want to create your first app but you\'re not overly tech-savvy, Python is the programming language that you need. It only takes a couple of hours to learn, and there are great tutorials online to teach you how to create your first app. It\'s not surprising that Python is the most taught programming language in US schools and colleges! Python makes programming accessible to all.” “Python is often my language of choice for making quick projects, like proofs of concepts and simple apps for internal use – this is because its libraries tend to have very simple, elegant, and expressive  .” \xa0 “Together with its framework Ruby on Rails [RoR], Ruby is characterized by its high-speed deployment thanks to available libraries, as well as its high-security level. RoR possesses several built-in features, such as SQL-injections and cross-site scripting that prevent most threats." “My personal preference at the moment for mobile apps is the React Native framework, which uses JavaScript. It allows for cross-platform development, so you\'re not spending time building two different native apps for iOS and Android. Native apps take a little more time but often offer more capabilities than hybrid apps. React Native\'s native modules (if necessary) works well to add flexibility. But also from a business perspective, there is a lot of available talent when it comes to JavaScript and React development.” “React Native is by far the best language for building and iterating on apps quickly for iOS and Android. If you are just starting to build an app, it’s a clear winner. It’s ideal for getting a prototype, MVP, or proof-of-concept app together. React Native is an open-source protocol, but it is also supported and developed actively by Facebook. It also has one of the largest dev communities in the world and a lot of libraries and integrations are constantly being built.” “Elixir combines the strengths of a functional programming language with an expressive syntax that is conducive to developer productivity. Elixir really shines when building highly scalable and highly reliable distributed systems. Paired with the Phoenix web framework, Elixir can be used to build real-time applications that support millions of concurrent connections and take advantage of all CPU cores. Pairing Elixir with the Nerves platform and tooling, businesses can build impressive experiences for embedded devices.” It’s obviously a much more complex than just simply choosing the  and running with it.

The Swift programming language was first developed by Chris Lattner in 2010, and later announced by Apple in 2014 at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. While it’s still relatively young, it has been through minor and major updates, with the most recent release of Swift 5 in 2019. Swift is a general-purpose, high-level programming language for Apple products that run on macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS and other platforms like Linux and IBM’s z/OS. The language is safe, fast and interactive which makes it popular among novice and advanced developers. Swift is designed to work with Apple’s Cocoa frameworks and was originally based Objective-C along with the runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, and   to run in the same programs with Swift.\xa0 Swift is a relatively new language, so it takes advantage of modern technology and its capabilities. However, it was developed using the best concepts from a variety of different programming languages such as Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby,  , and more. If you want to develop iOS apps, you should know Swift\xa0 – plain and simple it's the  . Swift is an open-source language, meaning anyone is welcome to contribute to it. It’s a static language with the main advantages being speed and security. The language is less tedious than others, as the syntax is generally cleaner, omitting the   Swift has a growing development community and a wide variety of resources behind it, which makes it less daunting for new programmers. Finally, Swift also scales easily. It’s simple to maintain as code written in earlier versions of Swift can be updated quickly. It also uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to manage your app’s memory usage in real time.  provides programmers with tools to develop apps, primarily acting as the interface used to write, compile, and debug code. Some IDEs are built for specific platforms, often with a language preference – for instance, Apple created the Xcode IDE for Mac users but it is compatible with other languages outside of Swift. Read reviews from real users to better understand which solution is best for you. Syntax refers to the layout of a programming language. For example, the syntax of an email would refer to the placement of the “.” or “@” symbols. If they aren’t in the proper order, it won’t work – similar to programming languages and coding. Simply put, you have to follow the syntax rules of the specific language. Now, let’s write and run our first Swift program. Open “Xcode” and select “Create a new Xcode project” from the options listed. Next, click on the “iOS” tab and choose the “Single View App” and hit “Next”. Name your product “HelloWorld”, then from the language dropdown menu select “Swift”. Notice that the Bundle Identifier automatically generates to “Bridget-Poetker.HelloWorld” from the product name and organization identifier. Click “Next”. On the center pane, scroll down to the “Deployment Info” section. From the devices dropdown, select “iPhone” and make sure only “Portrait” is checked for device orientation. Everything else can stay the same. Select “Main.storyboard” from the file structure on the left pane. This is where we will create the user interface for our app. Click “View Controller Scene” to expand, then click again on “View Controller”. Open the Objects Library by clicking the button in the top left (looks like the iPhone Home button). Pause and make sure the “View Controller” option is highlighted. From the Objects Library pop-up, drag and drop the “Label” option onto your view. Resize and center using the guides provided. With the label selected, change the alignment to centered text and bump up the font size in the right pane. Just above that, in the text box that says “Label” change it to “ ”. Make sure your label has plenty of breathing room because the output we create will also be popping up there. Then open the Objects Library again to drag and drop a “Button” onto the screen. Resize the object and input “ ” as your text. Now we need to actually write some code to tell the app what to do. Click on the “Assistant Editor” button in the top left (looks like a Venn Diagram) to see the view controller and main storyboard side by side. Close the other panes by clicking the buttons located in the top right of the window. We need to form a connection between the various objects and the associated code. To create an outlet, right click (or ctrl+click) on the name label and drag it just below the “UIViewController” in the code, a blue line should appear. Let go. Name it “ ” and click on the “Connect” button. To create an action for the button, right click on it and drag it below the text field outlet. Make sure the first drop down says “Action” and name it “ ”. Click “Connect”. At the very end of the line we just added, hit enter to start a new line within the curly brace of the Action. Type “   ”. Now it’s time to run your application! Click run, or the play icon, in the top left. If your code is correct, you’ll get a “Build Succeeded” pop up on your screen and a simulator will appear. Give it a test run, click on the button and your response should appear. Congrats, you did it! You’ve successfully created your first iPhone app using Swift. This was a very basic tutorial, and as you feel more comfortable with the language your apps will become more advanced. As Apple continues to expand its ecosystem, Swift will become increasingly important. The fast adoption of the Swift programming language means more future frameworks and features will be available to developers. "], 29: ["Getting into your customers’ minds is tough.\xa0 When working for a company, it’s easy to fall prey to thinking like an employee and not as a consumer. As an employee, you know the benefits of your product or service, you understand how to use it, and because of that, you may become influenced into assuming your product or service is the best of the best.\xa0 Unfortunately, this mindset often leaves us out of touch with our customers –\xa0the same customers who are seeing right through the perfect sales pitch and, instead, seeking out the   information about what you have to offer.\xa0 That’s why Newswire went to its G2 profile to check out what its real users were saying. It understood the value of reviews and the impact they have on sales. In fact, according to our  , displaying reviews can increase conversion rates by 270%.\xa0 Most people assume reviews are just for those shopping for a product or service, but reviews provide invaluable insights to improve and shift strategies for the company itself.\xa0 Negative user reviews mostly help identify areas of opportunity to improve your product or service, while positive reviews tell you what your customers already enjoy, so you can integrate those aspects into new strategies or offerings. In the case of Newswire, it was the latter. After discovering it had high overall customer satisfaction and customer service ratings on G2,   decided to leverage that strength and take its product to the next level.\xa0 Newswire hopes this high-touch service on a high-tech platform will transform the way it does business. According to G2 reviews from real users of Newswire’s software, customers said they loved Newswire’s software but weren’t using it to its fullest capabilities. Newswire needed to fill this gap to ensure their customer satisfaction ranking remained high.\xa0 Based on these insights, Newswire introduced the   Guided Tour.\xa0 Newswire says the goal of the Earned Media Advantage Guided Tour is to help customers transform their   campaigns. Newswire plans to help customers with high-touch customer service to create a comprehensive strategy that will increase brand awareness and increase traffic, with the ultimate intention of driving sales.\xa0 In an interview, Newswire said its customers will all work with an Earned Media Advantage Strategist (EMAS) to guide them and use the software for them. The intention is that the EMAS becomes an extension of your team. They will analyze your information and needs and create an executable Earned Media Advantage Plan, from there the EMAS will use Newswire’s software to create the optimal press and media distribution plan. Customers want to feel like they’re set up for success, and implementing a high-touch customer service team is one way to ensure they have direct access to answers. Newswire used information from its product reviews on G2 to identify an area where it was satisfying its customers (hands-on customer service) and invested heavier in that area, ultimately turning that insight into a new product offering. Authentic reviews limit risk, inform decisions, and eliminate biases. Whether you’re writing reviews to share knowledge, reading them to make a purchase, or analyzing them to better your product, reviews are changing the way decisions are made.\xa0 G2 alone hosts more than 875,000 reviews  . Each and every review holds important information that a software seller wouldn’t otherwise have. For example, with G2's Press Release Distribution Software G2 Grid®, sellers can analyze their strengths and weaknesses against competitors as seen below.\xa0 \xa0 These days it’s crucial that  . Positive reviews tell you what to keep doing, and negative reviews provide you with an opportunity to improve. Reviews take the guessing game out of thinking like a customer. They give you direct access. Take a page out of Newswire’s book and  . Through review analysis and careful planning, you could end up with a transformative, high-touch launch, like the Earned Media Advantage Guided Tour.\xa0 ", 'Before I buy anything, I ask for people’s opinions about the product and try to find reviews online. The worst types of reviews, in my opinion, communicate that a product arrived damaged or lasted only days before breaking. We all know how disappointing it is to do our research on a product, put our hard-earned money toward the purchase, only for it to poop out immediately. And don’t even get me STARTED on the complexities of a return process, especially for items originally purchased online. The best way to avoid this type of frustration, and to avoid having to execute your   strategy, is to invest in project quality management. Did you know it costs your company more to correct careless mistakes than it does to get it right the first time? You heard me - doing things right initially, no matter how difficult, is actually a time and money-saving measure in the end. As a project manager, you’re being pulled in multiple directions: people want you to complete a project on time, under-budget, and within the predetermined scope. It can be difficult to prioritize project quality alongside all of these other requirements, but it’s imperative you do.\xa0 A quality product or service is, to put it simply, “fit for its intended use.” A quality project has met its deliverables in a way that results in customer satisfaction.\xa0 \xa0 So, how can you execute project quality management alongside time management, project team member management, and project scope management?\xa0 The following three concepts will tell you what to focus on in order to make quality a clear priority. The customer or client is your number one concern when it comes to  . You want to be sure they’re satisfied with your work and that your project does what it was intended to do. Part of this is having clear deliverables and objectives so that everyone is referencing the same expectations. Additionally, frequently meeting with said customers or clients to determine whether they’re happy with progress is just as important.\xa0 Ensuring your customers are happy throughout various steps in the   will increase chances that they’re happy in the end. Checking in can decrease the risk of surprise dissatisfaction and will make your team feel more confident that their work aligns with expectations. In addition to the normal costs associated with your project (supply costs, employee paychecks, etc.), you’ll also have to factor in the cost of quality (COQ). This includes the money you spend during a project’s life cycle to resolve problems, as well as any money spent after the project’s completion to go back and rectify mistakes.\xa0 One great way to keep an eye on your projects is with a   (PPM) solution. Companies use PPM solutions to optimize their project portfolios and maximize revenues and return on investment. COQ can be split up into two categories: cost of conformance and cost of nonconformance.\xa0 Cost of conformance includes anything you spend money on in order to get a project done right the first time. Examples of cost of conformance are: testing, equipment cost, inspections, and employee training.\xa0 Nonconformance costs are anything you spend retroactively having to repair or rework part of or all of the project. Examples of nonconformance costs are: the cost of scrapping a project, any liabilities, or lost work. Continuous improvement is exactly as it sounds. This is the concept of constantly adjusting and making changes to better your processes and products. These changes can be large or small, but should work toward the same purpose.\xa0 A huge part of managing a project is keeping a record of steps taken, responsibilities completed, and milestones that were hit or missed. By analyzing these records and asking yourself and your team how you could improve those processes in future projects, you’re focusing on continuous improvement. Price and timeliness are great, but it’s quality that keeps customers coming back again and again. If you want to build a loyal, strong clientele that trusts you to get the job done, be sure you’re putting quality at the forefront of production.\xa0 ', "Businesses need money to survive. And in the era of technology, it seems that every company has a shiny new thing that’ll make their business more efficient, marketable, and profitable.\xa0 While investing in assets that make your business more productive is a must to survive today, it can distract you from the basic principles of what it means to run a company. Keeping your customers happy can help you establish mutually beneficial relationships. Showing empathy with communication can create more comfort. And   from satisfied buyers can build a prospect’s trust in your business before investing in your product.\xa0 This statistic alone makes one thing clear: if your business isn’t prioritizing high-quality review generation, you could be losing out on 90 percent of your customers, value-adding relationships, and recurring revenue.\xa0 Needless to say, product reviews are a big deal. Reading, evaluating, and applying peer insights has become a necessity before purchasing a solution, and online reputation holds more value now than ever before.\xa0 Today, investing in something as significant as a software tool for an entire business takes more than learning about the product. Customers want a complete picture of what it means to be involved with your company. What do you value as a business? What does your buying process look like? What are your customer service, support, and success experience like?\xa0 Sure, they can ask a sales rep all of these questions. However, to get the most beneficial and authentic insight, they’re going to turn to their peers and real-life users of your product for insight and a star rating. Here are a few more specific reasons why prioritizing online consumer reviews might be one of the best things you can do for your business. This data were sourced from a benchmark report done by   and Heinz Marketing or the mentioned brand below the statistic.\xa0 The buying process starts with identifying a problem and ends with making a purchase decision to solve it. Along the way, people research to find the best option for their business. While gut instincts and information on features and pricing say a lot, some people are looking for validation that buying your software is a good decision.\xa0 Enter reviews.\xa0 There are plenty of prospects sitting at the very edge of the conversion stage, just waiting for the final detail that shows them that they’re making the right choice. And reviews might be just the thing that helps them take that final step.\xa0 Social proof matters, and you’ll see that in your bottom line. Not only do reviews increase conversion rates, but they also make customers spend more. Every bit of assurance you can offer a prospective customer will only make them feel more secure in their purchasing decision, which can translate into them feeling comfortable spending more money per transaction. The visibility and   benefits you can gain from review sites is a great way to reach prospects. Investing in your presence on software review sites will help you reach buyers who are just starting their search and considering multiple products in the same category. The more (hopefully positive) content you generate there, the more quality insight customers can get into your business. Plus, that software review site becomes another location where prospective buyers can become aware of your business.\xa0 There are many places where potential customers can learn about your business. Your website and the conversations that customers have with your sales reps can provide valuable insights, but reviews offer details from the buyer’s side of things.\xa0 When reading reviews, buyers look for content on customer satisfaction from users of the same industry, business size, and role. Focusing on groups they can identify with will make the information even more valuable in their buying and decision-making process. This goes for both positive and  .\xa0 While receiving a poor review from a customer might not feel great at the moment, it’s always best to embrace and learn from it. All information is good information. Understanding what users dislike about a product or your customer experience is just as valuable as understanding what they like.\xa0 Put simply, people won’t buy your product without reading the reviews first. Today's customers understand the breadth of options they have before buying and value the input of real users when making their decision.\xa0 The buying process no longer exists without online customer reviews. Prospects can only be won over by your sales pitch and product information so much. They need both negative and positive online reviews to take them across the finish line and into buying territory. So invest in feedback from your customers through online reputation management. It will only help you progress, generate more revenue, and move toward achieving your business’ vision.

The thrill that today holds something different.\xa0 Events are also full of inspiration – perhaps a speaker will spark an idea that catapults your career. You may   who will impact your life for years to come. You could strike up a conversation with a fellow marketer whose company complements yours and decide to host your own event together. The opportunities really are endless! This ultimate guide to event marketing includes everything you need to execute and promote an event marketing strategy.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 While an event (especially a corporate one) isn’t quite the same as a birthday party, it still offers a certain level of excitement. There’s food, meeting new people, and hopefully a few laughs along the way! Even if it’s corporate, don’t forget that a business event is still just that: an event. The very definition of it means something out of the ordinary is about to occur! So, aside from a break from the office, what are the benefits of events as a form of marketing? What counts as event marketing, and how do you actually do it? This post is the first in a series of nine, where you’ll learn the answer to those questions and plenty more! This chapter will answer the following questions: So, let’s break away from the boring and dive into the world of event marketing!  holds immense potential for your overall marketing strategy. Ultimately it leads to revenue – your events will help keep current customers and get new ones. (This does indeed show your boss what a stellar marketer you are!) However, event marketing takes a lot of time and organizational skills. In addition, depending on the type of event, it can require a substantial budget. To recognize what counts as event marketing, let’s start with the basics – what it is! Any good guide includes definitions, so here is our G2's “real life, tell it like it is” definition of event marketing: So, if your company has an event marketing strategy, that means that you have a presence at events. You could be participating in a trade show, or it could be something smaller, such as an open house at your office. Alternatively, you could host or sponsor a conference that goes for multiple days. Events bring value to both the attendees and the company hosting the event – hence the rise of event marketing. Your marketing department my partake in events for a number of reasons. Some of the most common include increasing sales, leads, and brand awareness, and ultimately leading to sales. There is a wide range of events when it comes to the types of events and their sizes. For example, an event could be a small intimate group of 10-to-20 executives, or something as big as Dreamforce, the four-day conference run by Salesforce. And when I say big, I mean BIG.  \xa0 G2 Crowd sponsors Dreamforce every year, and I can say from experience it is just as massive as it sounds! In addition to sponsoring corporate events, a company might sponsor a charity event such as a 5K run or a festival. A company could also sponsor an event related to its community, activities such as fashion and film, or launch its own awards. The Dreamforce example focuses on a massive company. However, event marketing is utilized by companies of all sizes. It is also a marketing strategy for both B2B and B2C companies. It makes sense when you think about it – any company by definition has customers. Customers are all people: human beings to connect with at an event. Many times companies engaging in   focus on educational events, such as panel discussions and conferences. In addition to the marketing department, sales representatives also often attend events. Sales teams use events as an opportunity to reach out to prospects or renew current customers. Their work pre-event goes into calling and emailing to set up meetings. B2C companies often focus on events related to people’s hobbies and passions. Think of a wine company at a food festival, or a sports drink company sponsoring a half-marathon. The sports drink company might have a booth to give out free samples, knowing its target audience of athletic individuals is present. It is common for marketing teams to work with an agency or public relations firm when executing an event strategy. Nonprofits can also find a powerful impact in event marketing. For example, a non-profit may have a booth at a local community event. This gives the opportunity to get media coverage and increase brand awareness, the same way a for-profit company would. Nonprofits can also use event marketing for another important purpose – sourcing volunteers! The type of event you choose is impacted by a number of factors. These include your: Imagine a small local business with fewer than 15 total employees. It probably won’t start out investing its time and money into a two-day event designed to host 1,000 people! Let’s compare a small B2B company with a real-life example from a big B2C company. In general, “big” is also defined as “enterprise,” which G2 Crowd defines as a company which has more than 1,000 employees. Say you work at a small production company that produces content marketing videos for other businesses. You’ve just invested in some new equipment, including lighting and an expensive camera. You want to let your customers and prospects know about the high-quality videos you can produce with this equipment. Instead of sending an email to your database, you could invite them to an open house at your studio. The event could include some inexpensive appetizers and drinks, and the opportunity for guests to network. Then, show off your equipment and add a bit of fun to the evening. Instead of a photo booth, you might have a “video booth,” giving clients a chance to get on-camera. Maybe you have a short funny script for them to try out, or mock game show questions for attendees to compete with one another. After the event, you can send attendees their videos. Now you have given them a “product sample” of your new equipment’s quality. In addition, the sample stars the client, increasing the likelihood they will share it. (Hello, social media!) Plus, now that they’ve met you, you're able to build a one-on-one relationship with them. You had already invested in the equipment. Assuming you used digital tools, such as email or a web page to promote your event, there was no cost there. So, in this case, one of your two biggest costs was some light catering. The other cost? Time. While event marketing can be beneficial for companies of every size, it does take a notable amount of time. In addition to the planning, significant effort goes into event promotion. What’s the point putting your efforts into planning an event no one attends? The production company example previously given relates to B2B marketing. A great example of a B2C brand utilizing event marketing is the cosmetic brand L’Oréal, and its ongoing partnership with The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF.) To correspond with the event, it produced a line of lipstick and   for the film festival: the L'Oréal Paris Collection Privée. The glamour of the festival was tied in with the product, making it feel special. Plus, the line was limited edition. If you saw an exclusive Privée color you liked, you knew you had better buy it now! Not only did L'Oréal launch the Privée line, but it also built a  . Product samples were given out, giving a great way to attract attendees (who doesn’t love a freebie?!) and increase sales. Festival attendees were able to interact with the brand as they got their hair and nails done. It’s an experience L'Oréal knew its target market would love.\xa0 The second floor offered a VIP lounge experience. It was limited to a select few, giving it an aspirational quality. (Who doesn’t want to feel important?) L'Oréal got media coverage by inviting influencers to the VIP lounge, where they could write about the Privée line and their experience. Now that you know the “who,” let’s move onto the “why”! Basically, event marketing is used because it works. According to a 2018 report by Bizzabo,   believe live events are critical to their company’s success. The same study also reveals the average chief marketing officer designates   to events: When you consider how many marketing strategies and channels there are to choose from, it becomes apparent that marketers, all the way up to the highest level of decision-makers, (CMO = the big boss!) know the value of events. Two of the most considerable reasons events have an impact as a marketing strategy are: When you attend an event, you remember it. You were there in person. And, as discussed in the introduction, events are something to get excited about. You could be attending a content marketing conference for your job, or a weekend doughnut festival with friends. Either way, it is a break from the routine – a day on your calendar to look forward to with anticipation. Oh yes, and since events are so significant, let’s not forget they give you something to post on social media – an added benefit for both the company and the customer! The ability for brands to interact with individuals in person cannot be underestimated. Event marketers work because companies get face-to-face interaction with brands. Want the proof?   say live events give the opportunity to create valuable in-person connections. Perhaps this is why the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted that   from 2010 to 2020. Event marketing also works because you are putting yourself in a place where attendees can discover you. A customer may never have come across your brand via the internet, but when you are literally in the same place they are, it’s much harder to be missed! As Greg Oates, Executive Editor, Brand Strategy at Skift puts it: “With so much digital noise overwhelming our lives, CMOs are seeing live events in a new light to better engage distracted audiences.” Events also increase brand affinity, or how much people like your brand. It makes sense that the positive feelings about your company grow when people enjoy interacting with you! Aside from relationships, increased brand awareness and brand affinity (which are explored in the next chapter – The Benefits of Event Marketing), event marketing also works thanks to reciprocity. The principle of reciprocity is best explained by Robert Cialdini. It is one of the six principles of persuasion in his book, “Influence,” one of the most well-known books on the subject. Put simply, Cialdini explains reciprocity as “The rule that says we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.” Here you can learn more about reciprocity from Cialdini himself: \xa0 Both B2B and B2C companies can benefit from reciprocity at events. For example, a B2C company might sponsor a food festival. You stop by its booth and see it is giving away free sunglasses. Once you have received your pair, they ask you to try out the company’s product, or add you to a email list. Consider a B2B event. While hosting an exclusive dinner may not result in an immediate sale, it increases the chance for one. A busy executive who may have turned down meeting with your sales team is now more likely to share his or her time. And it’s all thanks to the time and effort you put into the experience you gave them. Hooray for reciprocity in action! Events are a fun way to grow your marketing strategy. They require a substantial amount of work, but the benefits are definitely worth it! There is plenty to consider when executing your event, and many types of events to choose from for both B2B and B2C marketers, and businesses of every size. This is the first of nine chapters in this series, where I'll go through everything you need to know when it comes to event marketing and execution, including: the  , working with sponsors, the first steps in executing your event, and how to brand your event. (That's one of my favorite parts - making it an experience to remember!) Now it's time for Chapter Two -\xa0 Otherwise, feel free to jump ahead to other chapters and articles for event planning and execution: \xa0 ", "Marketing means conferences and conferences mean planning. All of this can lead to a big headache if you don't plan ahead.\xa0 Imagine being faced with a binder of deadlines that feel overwhelming. You have to accomplish a huge feat of planning a conference when you never have before.\xa0 What do you do?\xa0 As you might have guessed, this happened to me when planning the  . Fortunately, I was given a large binder chock full of information from past events with marketers' knowledge on vendors, sponsors, attendees, brand standards, and more. In order to not overlook small details, it’s important to remember the following five tips as you begin planning for your conference. You know what makes planning a huge event less daunting? Smaller, incremental deadlines. Once you set your actual event date, think about how much time YOU’LL need to complete the tasks at hand. We’ll get into the month-by-month overview soon!\xa0 If you’re in the nonprofit sector or planning a conference in general, you’re a superhero. But every superhero has a sidekick. That’s why you should appoint somebody to be in charge of each of these groups if possible:\xa0 Not throwing a huge event? You won’t need somebody at the helm of each of these groups. Just remember: if you start to feel overwhelmed, it’s time to delegate.\xa0 Imagine yourself as an attendee. Now, as a sponsor. What would you expect as part of a conference? What information would you want to know and when? Make sure to incorporate all of the communication and touchpoints you would want if you were attending the event or sponsoring it. Keep lines of communication open by using\xa0 Add innovative, social media friendly activities to your event, like a slo-mo video booth. Sometimes these fun additions have no purpose, but they definitely help increase your social media presence. Make sure your attendees not only learn a ton but also have a smile on their face the whole day! If your attendees remember the amazing time they had, they’ll be more likely to come back in the future or recommend it to others.\xa0 Things WILL go wrong. Your keynote speaker's flight might be delayed or cancelled. You might not be able to find an alternative way to get them to the conference in time. So what do you do? Improvise.\xa0 In our scenario, we decided day-of to pull speakers who were interested in a panel discussion and let the attendees ask pressing questions. This g After reading the tips above, you might be wondering what you should be doing and when you should be doing it!\xa0From start to end, read the detailed version of the checklist below.\xa0 Money matters when  . Don’t have any? Sponsorships are often given by businesses looking to do their part (and to have a booth or their name featured at your event or on promotional materials). Realistically, how many people would be ideal to attend? What is your main goal with the conference? If this is not an inaugural conference, how many people have attended previous years? Make sure to use those attendee lists and set a realistic goal based on them.  For some reason, this can be nerve-wracking. You’ll inevitably go through the “what if I overlooked some huge event already being held this day?!” Don’t overthink, but do your research! Look at other types of conferences that align with yours and make sure you’re not scheduling to compete for attendees.\xa0   If this is a brand new conference, you’ll need to do a great deal of branding before anything else can get put into motion.  T When you’re competing with weddings, family reunions, and maybe even bigger conferences, you want to leave nothing to chance. Do this at LEAST 10 months in advance. You’ll need the space secured so you can start advertising and letting speakers know! The sooner the better! Need help? Check out   to help streamline the process!\xa0   You should be in full swing at this point. Email marketing, social media marketing, shouting from the mountaintops…you get the idea. Utilize lists available of previous attendees, find new people to target with social media marketing, and anything else to up your numbers.\xa0    H   Whether it’s putting together packets or folding programs, try to get everything assembled and ready to take to the venue before the night before the event. This is where volunteers come in hand.\xa0 If you’ve prepped each point of contact, this should run smoothly! It’s now your job to simply help where need be!   Send  . Looking to make next year an even bigger success? Ask your attendees, speakers, sponsors, vendors, and volunteers what they liked, would like to be different, and so on. You did it! Seriously, you should check this box. Whether it’s a formal party popping bubbles, or a bubble bath reading a book you’ve been putting off, celebrate in your own way, then consider this list complete!\xa0 ", 'An event planner plans events. Not so fast. As simple as   sounds, there’s actually   more to it than what initially meets the eye. The word “event” is a broad term, which I’m sure makes you wonder which   of events we’re talking about exactly? Event planners work on conferences, corporate events, special events, meetings, trade shows, exhibitions, and concerts – just to name just  . And we can’t forget the specific duties at these events, which broadly fall under planning, managing, and coordinating. Just think about all of the little details that need to be accounted for at an event! Planning events brings a whirlwind of duties, tasks, and projects, which all need someone to be in charge of. I told you there’s so much more to it! The job title “event planner” barely scratches the surface of the immense career possibilities one can have in the event industry. If you’re looking for a job in the event space, but you’re not finding exactly what you’re looking for, then it’s time to expand your search. With the wide variation of event duties, it makes sense that there are so many job titles to accommodate them. This article will walk you through the six most common event planning titles, responsibilities, and necessary qualifications to ensure you find your perfect fit in the event industry. As I said previously, an event planner title can be used as a catch-all description, but it is definitely not one to be overlooked. An event planner runs the show and typically is in charge of every single detail of an event if there’s no one else hired to take over the more specific roles. Event planners take hold of the reigns right at an event’s conception and lead the ideating, venue selection, negotiations, logistics, and well, everything else! From planning weddings, birthday parties, corporate events, ceremonies, and much more, event planners bring visions to life and manage every step of the event cycle. Think of the event coordinator as the event planner’s right-hand man. When a coordinator is involved in the event planning process, he or she takes over the details and smaller jobs that the event planner needs them to do. The event planner is in charge of the most important aspects, ideating and putting the vision and plan together, while the coordinator gets it done (with the guidance from the planner, of course.) A coordinator typically ensures that the event planner’s vision is followed through. This means delegating and managing all of the specific teams that have a part in making the event design a reality. The natural next step for many coordinators is to become an event planner. The coordinator job allows you to get loads of valuable, hands-on experience that will help you in the future. You might see the title “meeting planner” accompanied by event planners often. This is because event planners and meeting planners have essentially the same job description, just one is in charge of events and the other is in charge of, you guessed it, meetings! There is a large need for meeting planners in the government and corporate world. Organizing important meetings held and attended by people such as top executives and high government officials is not as simple as just booking a conference room and conducting a meeting. When sensitive information needs to be shared with a large number of important (and very busy) people involved, a meeting planner comes to the rescue and handles the logistics of it all – providing a great experience for the attendees. Venue managers work for the venue and handle everything that has to do with the logistics of the event in relation to the venue space itself. Knowing exactly how to arrange the room to accommodate a variety of events, people, and activities are their expertise, ensuring that the operations of the event never fail. Venue managers are also in charge of the booking processes, contracts, and staff that work for the venue. Being an expert of their event space is the name of the job, and being able to troubleshoot and overcome any issues that may arise during the duration of the event cycle is what venue managers are there for. The catering manager is in charge of everything food-related at an event. This means expense control, menu creation, food preparation, allergy awareness, catering schedules, food safety, and more. Catering managers have to be very meticulous, ensuring that the proper calculations are done and the contracts are correct to guarantee little to no profit loss. They should also have a culinary background of some sort, as it is important to be an expert of not only the event planning side but the proper food handling and detail needed to meet code and guest standards. Don’t let the word “marketing” scare you, because whether you know it or not, the event industry has a strong marketing backbone, and you are probably more familiar with marketing than you think. Event marketing is a promotional strategy that companies use to interact with their prospects and customers in an engaging and face-to-face format. The event marketing manager leads a company or organization’s event strategy. This can be in the form of trade shows, local activations, and events, sponsored events, or even the company’s very own event! The duties of an event marketer at these events are very similar to that of an event planner, just remember, the events planned in this role are all part of a greater strategy for business gain, not just for attendee enjoyment and experience like the others. It’s important to note that event marketing managers typically work for a company, planning and executing events just for that company. That’s the beauty of it! The event industry has so much to offer and can provide you with a fun and fulfilling career for years to come. Figure out which job is right for you at this time, but remember, an event career path is fluid. You should feel encouraged to jump around the industry and get your hands in everything. With the amount of possibility, there’s no telling where you can end up next. '], 3: [" provides a platform for business owners to set up an e-commerce shop on a variety of different platforms.

While it might be relatively easy to launch an  , it's a completely different story to build one that actually brings in profit. The process is challenging, and tons of online stores barely manage to keep afloat. If you're not seeing the desired results from your business, there’s a chance you might be doing something wrong. The good news is this: by avoiding some of the most common e-commerce mistakes, your business can grow and thrive. Let's discuss these issues and what you can do to fix them. First things first: it's not enough to just set up your store to see the sales rolling in. You have to be proactive and create constant buzz around your business so that people find out about your store and actually start shopping there. There are several things you can do to get people talking about your business and generate traffic. As soon as you launch your store, let everyone know. Ask your friends and family to support your business by sharing it with people they know on social networks. This tactic is often overlooked but can help you broaden your reach and spread the word faster. With the right kind of strategy (and a little bit of luck), you can generate traffic overnight. You can also use a good   to help learn more about what you're doing right! If you've built your   thinking anyone can be a customer, think again. For your business to grow, you have to break down the market into manageable chunks and think of how to differentiate your store from thousands of others. If you find yourself lacking in traffic, it might be a good idea to rethink your ideal client and address a more specific market. In other words, you have to find your niche. A niche is a   for which your product is created. For example, SKINS sportswear targets professional athletes and people who are serious about sports, not just everyone who likes wearing sportswear.\xa0 Defining your target audience is important for several reasons. First, it helps you narrow down your competitors; if you haven't precisely defined your audience, you're basically competing against other e-commerce businesses that target masses, including giants like Amazon, eBay, and similar. Additionally, defining your target audience will help you to rank higher on search engines because it will narrow down your ideal keywords. For example, you’ll have a better chance to rank on long tail keywords like ''zero waste party accessories'', rather than high volume and high competition keywords like ''party accessories''. Answering these questions and applying your answers to your marketing strategy will help you to narrow down your audience and raise your traffic. In online business, it's all about the appearance and making your e-commerce store look and feel as professional as possible. This means compelling copy, high-quality visuals, and intuitive navigation. Unfortunately, an amateur website design is still one of the most common e-commerce mistakes that entrepreneurs make.

The first decision you have to take is to analyze and finalize to what modern e-commerce platform your company is going to be shifted. Next, do deep research and find out all the data (Re: each and every data that needs to be moved from here to there). There’s going to be a lot.

But as business owners, when should you take that decision?\xa0 If your e-commerce store is not in line with industry standards; if your e-commerce store is not offering a rich customer experience; if your e-commerce store is not supporting other integrations; if your e-commerce store is custom-built or an outdated platform; if you are already on a SaaS platform and are looking out for new features.

"], 9: ['As a nonprofit professional, you know the value of developing genuine relationships with your organization’s supporters.\xa0 People can see through the efforts of a faulty or fake attempt to connect and communicate with them. Instead, it’s important to strategically build an approach that will help you authentically build these relationships. Authentic relationships help nonprofits  . This is because these connections help increase your donor retention rates, and, therefore, revenue. When donors give more over time, not only does your nonprofit secure that additional revenue, but you can also spend less on your acquisition of new supporters. Plus, when donors give more frequently over time, their donation amounts tend to increase. Building relationships and focusing on donor retention is more important right now than ever before. Difficult economic circumstances make fundraising increasingly difficult for nonprofit professionals. Understanding that your supporters may not be able to give right now, but continuing your stewardship plan and interactions with them shows that you truly care. In order to build strong and authentic relationships that last with your supporters, we recommend these strategies: No matter the external conditions that your nonprofit experiences, you have an opportunity to really show your supporters how much you care and strengthen your connection with them. The second donation a donor gives to a nonprofit organization is referred to as the  . This is because new donor retention rates tend to be much lower than the retention rates for those who have given multiple times. When you start with a strong foundation for donor relationships, you increase the chances of receiving that golden donation, thus increasing the chances that your donors will give more in the future. When you think about increasing donor retention through relationships, start by building relationships from the very beginning.  is a great way to begin relationships on a positive note. Specifically, according to that study, donors who were called within 90 days of contributing were shown to: When donors first give to your organization, be sure to build a strong foundation for the relationship by showing personal appreciation for their contributions. You should also save the information you collect about these supporters to comprehensive profiles in your . This way, when you reach out in the future, be that in face-to-face meetings, over email, or over the phone, you’ll be able to personalize the conversation and address the individual interests and engagement history of supporters. One of the primary aspects that can make or break a relationship (with anyone) is trust. If your donors don’t feel like they can trust your organization, they’ll stop giving. You can   feel with your organization by increasing your levels of transparency. Transparency is a two-way street. Provide opportunities for supporters to be transparent with your organization about their opinions. Encourage your supporters to fill out surveys and give honest feedback about your nonprofit’s operations. Then, take this feedback seriously. Responding and changing according to the suggestions that will make you stronger shows your supporters that you value their opinions. This helps your supporters feel like true partners to the organization. In addition to encouraging transparency from your supporters, make sure you’re also being transparent with them.\xa0Many of the reasons that people stop giving to organizations can be prevented if organizations are more transparent with supporters. According to  , here are the reasons why people tend to stop giving to nonprofits: As you can see, simply increasing communication with these lapsed donors before they stopped giving would’ve helped maintain their support for a longer period of time. Be sure to effectively communicate relevant information with your supporters. For example, you should be sure to tell donors about your latest fundraising campaign successes (and failures). And tell them about the impact you’re making in the community. Increasing transparency about the impact you can make and how their monies are making a difference is a compelling reason for supporters to give again. In order for your nonprofit to ensure the transparency that we discussed in the last section, you’ll need an effective communication strategy. If donors don’t engage with your messages, there will be a natural gap in your transparency and general communication of ideas. Therefore, consider carefully the different communication platforms that are available to you and how your supporters will respond to each platform based on the information you know about the audience. Make sure you use your communication strategy to provide donors with all of the information they need to continue interacting with your nonprofit. For example, tell them about upcoming campaigns, events, news updates, webinars, or other engagement opportunities. Don’t use the same general message for each platform. Instead, customize it for the format that the platform specializes in. For instance, some of the platforms you might consider include emails, websites, video meetings, social media, and annual reports. Email is also the ideal platform for long-form content. This is content that is sent specifically to your supporters. They don’t stumble upon it at random. Therefore, you’re more likely to hold their attention than if they had just come across your update at random. Don’t email your supporters too frequently, or else they may stop reading the messages you send. However, email them often enough to stay in front of their minds. Generally, one email per week should be sufficient to keep in touch with supporters. Lastly, make sure your emails provide valuable information. Don’t just email supporters for the sake of emailing them.  , programming updates, event reminders, and donation requests are just some examples that you can alternate between to keep your content fresh. When supporters want to learn more about your organization, the first place they’ll go to research is your  . Make sure you provide all of the detailed information necessary for this research on your site. You might make this research process easy for your supporters by compiling relevant information in specific locations. For example, you can create individual event pages that have all relevant information about the events (regular or virtual) that you host. Video meetings have a unique ability for you to use both audio and facial expressions to communicate effectively. Plus, it allows for a true back-and-forth between those conversing. Many people will find it easier to schedule a meeting from the comfort of their homes easier than meeting in person. Both are valuable options that provide a personalized experience and effective communication with your supporters. Therefore, offer both options to see which will better fit with your supporters’ schedule and preferences. Social media provides a great opportunity for your nonprofit to build brand awareness and community among your supporters. Develop a specific   that takes into consideration your specific goals for the platforms and the audience that you want to reach. Invite supporters to engage with your social media by creating a specific hashtag for your organization. Or, create enticing videos that will draw the attention of your audience. Use Instagram and Facebook stories to reach your younger audiences and give small, entertaining updates or fun facts about your mission. Your nonprofit’s annual report is a once-per-year opportunity to really dive into the activities that your organization has accomplished and to highlight your fundraising successes.  explains how your annual report can be used to strengthen donor relationships by highlighting your key supporters. It should also be worded using  , which puts all of the accomplishments throughout the year in terms of your supporters and how they made it possible to achieve.\xa0 You probably know that you should send a “thank you” message to your supporters after they donate to your nonprofit. This shows immediate appreciation and confirms that their contribution was received. Take this message to the next level by personalizing it with the supporter’s name and their contribution amount. Fundraising Letters offers free   that can give great insight into what this personalization looks like. While this appreciation message (usually over email) is a great start to appreciating your donors, it’s not the be-all, end-all solution. You should go above and beyond to show your donors how much they mean to you in order to build the types of relationships you’re both looking for and  . You may consider strategies such as: Get creative with your strategies to show appreciation to your supporters.\xa0Make sure that you provide them with insight into the impact they’ve made on your philanthropic mission as you thank donors. This message is valuable and effective because it mentions the donor’s name, the amount they contributed, the impact that contribution had for the organization, and a specific party (Sammy) who benefitted from the donation. Donors recognize when your organization is being authentic with them. Truly believing in the value that your supporters provide to your nonprofit is the only way to communicate just how appreciative you are for them. After all, you wouldn’t be able to achieve your mission without their incredible support.\xa0 ', "If you work in or around the nonprofit world, you’ve likely seen the benefits of online fundraising. Recent advancements in technology have allowed nonprofits to   through features like embeddable donation buttons for their website, online giving pages, virtual events, and even website AI. The future will likely bring even more exciting tools for nonprofits to utilize. But with new advancements come new opportunities to disrupt your fundraising ecosystem. This can create frustration for you, your team, and your donors. In this blog post, we’ll explain what your ecosystem is, how data can disrupt it, and how you can set a foundation for fundraising success. When it comes to  , the best strategy is a holistic one. A nonprofit’s efforts, whether in-person or online, work best when they’re integrated. By leaning into your organization’s strengths and improving the weaker areas, you’ll have a more robust and healthy fundraising ecosystem. If you’ve ever studied biology or watched a few episodes of  , you know how delicate the balance is between living things and the environment. Interconnectedness is key with properly-ordered ecosystems. Your fundraising ecosystem is no different. Your online fundraising ecosystem consists of all the tools you use that have information about your contacts and donors. As you expand your online fundraising tools, there will be more information to balance and connect together. But in order to ensure that everything is working together properly, you’ll first need to understand all the tools within your ecosystem. Nonprofits that add more and more online fundraising tools without a way to   run the risk of experiencing diminishing returns with their software. This means you’re investing more in your software tools but you’re not receiving a return on your investments. That’s why it’s important to have a “source of truth” when building your fundraising foundation. This source of truth is the place where all of your data is stored and easily accessible. It’s also important to review your online fundraising ecosystem because technology is always changing. The software options that worked for you last year may not work this year. Maybe it’s time to consider a new payment processor, email marketing platform, or online giving provider. That's why we recommend you assess your software suite at least every year. That way you can see what’s working for you, what isn’t, and what new tools may exist now to set you up for the most fundraising success. Before we move on to the tools in your ecosystem, we want to share a potential scenario that will drive home this point about the importance of having a strong foundation and source of truth. Imagine you’re getting ready to meet one of your major donors for coffee. You’ve had a busy day, which means you didn’t have the chance to prepare for your conversation before getting to the coffee shop. The good news is that you arrive five minutes early so you have time to catch your breath and prep to meet with this very important donor. Now, in the five minutes that you have in the parking lot, how do you find all the information your organization has about this donor? When did they last give, and how much was their gift? Do they subscribe to your emails? Have you or has someone else from your organization sent a direct appeal recently? Have they ever participated in one of your peer-to-peer fundraisers? If your data is disorganized, it will be almost impossible to find this information quickly on your phone before a donor meeting. You’d have to pull up your donor database, your email service provider, your direct mail records, your peer-to-peer fundraising platform, and more. And even then, this information is scattered and hard to put together into a coherent story. You’ll end up being late to coffee, frustrated, and still unprepared for your meeting with your donor. When you look at it that way, can you really afford for your data to be disorganized? That’s why it’s so important to organize your online fundraising data. You have valuable information about your donors and their relationship with your organization in several different sources. You need to be able to access this information quickly and coherently whenever you need it. That means you need to be able to access it all in one place, and ideally, you would be able to pull it up on your phone before your next donor meeting or phone call. Now that you’re ready to get organized, the first thing you need to do is to identify each source of your fundraising and donor data. This will set the framework for your online fundraising strategy. We’ll break down five broad areas to consider when looking for your data. You can also download a PDF copy of this   to help guide you through the information. Once you’ve documented all the sources of your fundraising and donor data, it’s time to get your team together to ask some honest questions about how well your organization is doing today: After asking these questions, you may find that your nonprofit is already doing well with data organization. If so, great work! Keep using the tactics and strategies that are working well for your nonprofit. But if you think your fundraising information is becoming more and more scattered, there’s a simple way to get organized. Our recommended solution may surprise you: Add one more tool to your software suite. Specifically, we recommend adding a donor management tool. You might be wondering why you should invest in more software. Won’t that just add to the mess instead of organizing it? One of the   is that it can connect the data from   of your online fundraising sources. It’s the software that holds all your other software together. That way, you can continue to expand your online fundraising suite without continuing to spread out your data. Even if you’re already using a donor management system, it may not integrate with the other online fundraising software you’re using. In this case, you may want to consider another option that does. You’ll also want to make sure your next solution can help you   into the new system. Putting a donor management system in place that can integrate with your online fundraising tools is the foundation that will springboard your fundraising efforts. It will grow with you, allowing you to continue expanding your online fundraising suite and maximize your fundraising efforts. The process of organizing your data and keeping it organized won’t happen by itself. You’ll have to make sure you have the right person to take on this responsibility.\xa0So who’s the right person for the job? We’ve put together some questions to help you determine if you need an online fundraising manager. You may have never considered an online fundraising manager as an important or necessary role for your nonprofit. But the more you invest in your online fundraising ecosystem, the more important it is to designate the responsibility to someone on your team or even hire someone to take ownership of your online fundraising efforts. Once you’ve identified the need for your organization and are ready to consider a person for the role, you’ll want to make sure you find someone who’s fit to do the job. For many nonprofits, the idea of adding this responsibility may seem overwhelming, especially if you have a smaller team or are on a tight budget. But depending on the donor management provider that you choose, it may not be necessary to have a person completely dedicated to managing online fundraising. Check and see if your donor management provider offers onboarding or training. Consider investing in these services. That way, a professional can guide you through the process of getting your data organized, and you won’t have to worry about adding the extra responsibilities to your team. If you don’t have a donor management system yet, check and see if onboarding and training services are available when you research your options. This will help you make the most of your investment by keeping your data organized. Online fundraising is an effective way for modern nonprofits to raise more funds and strengthen their relationships with their donors – just make sure you have the proper foundations in place for success. If you haven’t already, make sure you complete your online fundraising audit. The next step is working with your team through your organization checklist and deciding what next steps are best for you, whether you add an online fundraising manager to your team or add a donor management system that will connect your online fundraising ecosystem together.\xa0 ", 'Your nonprofit may be backed by many generous supporters, but are you making the most of their contributions?\xa0 Your organization should take advantage of every possible opportunity you get to maximize your revenue. It’s no surprise that many small nonprofits struggle to raise money they need. Gathering enough support from your community through major marketing initiatives can be a challenge for your already-stretched team members. You’re passionate about your cause, but  , it will be harder for your nonprofit to succeed   thrive. When you feel as though your organization needs a bit of a push to improve, it may be time to re-evaluate your  .\xa0 By targeting your weak areas by taking advantage of existing improvement opportunities, you can ramp up your fundraising and strengthen your nonprofit’s ability to raise support for its mission in no time. Let’s get started!  As a nonprofit professional, you know how important it is to show your appreciation after a donation. Letting donors know that you value their gifts and the time they devote to your organization can boost relationships more than you’d initially expect. However, it’s also important to make sure the conversation isn’t just one-sided. Encourage supporters to provide feedback. Then, make sure your organization acknowledges their concerns.The communication process can even be simplified by conducting outreach  .\xa0 Make sure you effectively hold up your side of the conversation with supporters. Approach any communication with the intent to grab the attention of your audience. According to last year’s  , 54% of donors worldwide prefer to give online, which means they’ll likely also read your messages online. So,   with the following best practices: Direct mail donations represent about 11% of all charitable donations. Therefore, you’ll want to  so try the following: While most gifts are given online these days, most of your  donations are given after a face-to-face conversation. Make sure to frame your conversation correctly by first asking about the philanthropic impact they want to make, then focusing on the effect the person’s donation will have on your organization.\xa0 Don’t overlook any form of communication, because you want every last charitable donation you can get. Even though  , you’ll miss out on a large number of donations if you   focus on email communication. The remaining 31% is accounted for by print letters, text messages, postcards, social media messages, and phone calls. Building an effective   for your fundraising campaigns will also require you to  towards a particular segment of your donor base. For instance, mid-level donors are frequently overlooked by nonprofits.\xa0 Generally, nonprofits focus heavily on stewarding their major donors or acquiring new supporters, both of which are great strategies! However, it leaves your mid-tier donors without much attention. These are the donors you want to cultivate to reach those upper-level donation amounts. The first step in better targeting this segment of your donor base is figuring out who your mid-level donors are. Run a report to find out who falls between the categories of your largest and smallest donors. The second step is engaging them. When you  , you can more deliberately cultivate your relationships with mid-tier donors. No matter where exactly they fall within the mid-tier range, show them how their support helps further your mission, and as always, say thank you.\xa0 As you get started implementing more effective communication strategies, remember that   Get to know your donors and their preferences, and always keep an open line of communication. That way, they’ll feel valued, and you won’t miss out on any fundraising opportunities.  This is the simplest  . When you listen to their feedback and concerns and then take action, you’ll gain your supporters’ trust and make them feel respected and appreciated.\xa0 To simplify the feedback process necessary for strong donor retention, create a questionnaire to gauge areas of improvement. Instead of posting the survey on your website, send it directly to donors via email. Keep open-ended questions limited so as not to bore participants, but including one to two can add immense value to the questionnaire. By collecting information directly from your supporters, you can better personalize the messages you use to communicate with them. Donor management software allows you to store personalized information about each and every one of your donors, including relevant documents, demographics, relationships, and notes. Plus, with the right software, you can even create these messages within the CRM. For instance, donor management software allows you to manage your entire list of supporters, create email newsletters, track individuals’ engagement histories, analyze your data through its generated smart reports, and much more. With strong donor management software in your tech toolbox, you can also more easily conduct prospect research to further personalize interactions and identify prospective major donors. Look into your supporters’ philanthropic and wealth indicators to determine how much they can give as well as how likely they are to give. When selecting the right prospect research technology, keep an eye out for features that allow you to conduct social discovery. Social discovery is one type of prospect development that focuses on donors’ social factors. Factors like  and social media  can effectively indicate affinity, capacity, philanthropic interests, and professional stability. Remember that when choosing the right donor database software, look for a solution that integrates with your donor database. This makes it easy to store the information you collect for the future. When your donors feel as though you’ve taken the time to get to know them, they’ll be more likely to stick around and continue contributing.\xa0 One often overlooked revenue source is corporate giving programs. They stem from employees’ engagement with specific nonprofits and aim to multiply their contributions. According to Double the Donations’  , 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer matching gift programs, but an estimated $4 to $7 billion in matching gift funds goes unclaimed every year. Think of all the money you could miss out on by not taking advantage of these programs.  When you tell your supporters about these opportunities, they’re much more likely to give and, in some cases, even give more. In fact, 84% of donors say they’re more likely to donate if a match is offered. Offering tools and resources for your supporters to check their own eligibility is a smart move. By implementing a tool like this, you educate your supporters and make it easier for them to multiply their contributions. This is an easy way to bridge the gap in knowledge about  . Peer-to-peer fundraising is a great way to get your supporters engaged, acquire new donors, and boost revenue all at once! Any nonprofit can benefit from peer-to-peer fundraising but  if they think through their approach. While smaller nonprofits might be able to have a successful peer-to-peer fundraiser with limited tech resources, larger nonprofits may find investing in more comprehensive   to be helpful in their campaign efforts.\xa0 While it is a cost-effective way to raise more money, it can take a lot of effort from everyone involved.  Peer-to-peer fundraising is a powerfully effective way to revamp your fundraising strategy while also engaging your supporters. Plus, when your supporters are reaching out to their friends and family to support your organization, your nonprofit reaches new and exciting audiences (great for donor acquisition!).\xa0 Making small adjustments can make a huge impact on your organization’s fundraising, so cover all your bases by practicing  , focusing on  , and exploring  . Remember,  requires careful planning, but the process can be simplified through  . Any nonprofit can benefit from peer-to-peer campaigning, so find out what it can do for your organization!\xa0 Every donation matters, so make use of all available information about your volunteers, donors, and other supporters to personalize your outreach. By taking advantage of all opportunities, you can take your fundraising to the next level.\xa0 '], 53: ["Interoperability. That’s not a word that rolls off the tongue easily. So you might already be wondering what it is. But in the health IT industry, healthcare professionals already know. What exactly is interoperability? Let's discuss.\xa0 This way, any healthcare professional from anywhere in the world can access the patient’s records and provide care and treatment without delay. Though it may sound all rosy and good, there are some barriers to  . In this article, we will be talking about those barriers and how to overcome them.\xa0 Before actually getting into the barriers, it is worth understanding interoperability and the different levels in interoperability first to see how barriers can actually arise.\xa0 There are three levels of interoperability: Structural, Foundational, and Semantic. Each of these levels have their capabilities and uses in the  . Hospitals and clinics assume different levels of interoperability depending on the information, the data to be shared, and the patient’s condition. There are two kinds of interoperability based on the deployment category: cloud-based deployment and on-premise interoperability. Through cloud-based interoperability, the users can utilize the same management tools and software with a number of other cloud computing platforms and providers. On-premise interoperability is mainly used by large hospitals when they have huge sets of data and they share it with different departments of the hospital. This way, the doctors can avail information about the patient without having anyone providing them physically. On-premise interoperability can definitely save a lot of time and energy, and provide better deliverance.\xa0 Data interoperability on the basis of the application here means collecting and sharing data while a diagnosis is made. Apart from  , clinicians have begun to use technologically upgraded healthcare interoperability software that would considerably reduce errors while the diagnosis is made. Early diagnosis can reduce mortality rates. A huge repository of data is thus being disseminated at the diagnosis stage so they can be shared as people get diagnosed at the initial stage.\xa0 Interoperability at the application level extends to not just the diagnosis level, but at the treatment level too. There is considerable growth in the treatment segment because of the increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases, and the number of patients seeking treatment for chronic diseases has increased as well. When data is shared on the basis of a centralized model, there is a higher level of protection because once the healthcare professionals share the data in a particular repository, it can be seen by other professionals or repositories only when they send in the request and permission is granted. This would prevent unauthorized sharing of data, and can prevent data breaches to a great extent.\xa0 The hybrid model was also in great demand because it had several benefits associated with it. Hybrid interoperable software can really cut down operational costs. A major difference that this model has with the centralized model is that you don’t have to create a separate consolidated data center, and this helps in preventing time delays. The end-user mentioned here is most definitely the patient. And with the growing occurrence of chronic diseases, patient admissions are also increasing. More patient admissions means more data and this calls for better and highly effective interoperability solutions. The number of surgeries is also increasing because the number of chronic illnesses has increased, and this would lead to consequent generation of patient data; data that must be used appropriately. The government initiatives in the North American healthcare sector are allowing a robust growth of data interoperability in that area. The government is also spending well for the effective use of EHR and for the quick, effective and safe data exchange across all channels and healthcare departments. This has escalated the growth of a particular region when compared to the others. The Asia Pacific (consisting of India, Japan, China, Australia, South Korea, Bangladesh, Nepal, North Korea, etc.) healthcare data interoperability market is also seeing immense growth, and the governments in these countries are also increasing their expenditure to ensure secure healthcare facilities, including pharmacies.\xa0 Keeping the aforementioned points in mind, let’s have a look at the challenges in achieving interoperability. As the number of data sources increases, so will the amount of data that’s coming in. And this would increase when more patients are using  . The huge influx of patient-generated health data comes from elderly patients, patients with chronic conditions, in-hospital patients, from wellness programs and even from remote patient monitoring systems. All the levels of interoperability that we mentioned above come into practice here. But the problem is that all this information requires several layers of interoperability, and also involves semantic interoperability and syntactic interoperability. And there could also be social, cultural, economic and even policy barriers to interoperability. So when the influx of data is huge, then it would be difficult to clear them all and collect relevant data. The more partnerships you form, the more complicated it becomes to manage them. For example, if a huge hospital system acquires smaller hospitals, then aligning the IT systems could be a tough job. These   systems may have to combat a number of tasks in order to make the data interoperable, including scheduling, and even sometimes converting the paper records. Often when acquisition happens, this part is often neglected, leading to time-consuming jobs by the IT people. In order to ensure that the end-user or the patient doesn't suffer as a result of the acquisitions, the hospital systems must conduct a thorough audit and then make an interoperability game plan. Make a reasonable timetable to move the data and make it interoperable so the healthcare professionals and the patients would benefit from it.\xa0 You can think of interoperability as having two different layers: one layer would be the data layer, and the other, the workflow layer. Problems with workflows can hinder interoperability. Actually, workflow interoperability is one layer above data interoperability, and it is much more difficult to achieve. Sharing data is one thing, but sharing the workflow of another organization and using that information to coordinate it with the internal workflow of another organization is critical.\xa0 Once that happens seamlessly, because there would be both speed and quality, the patient can move from one clinic to another or from a clinic to a rehabilitation center and back (each would require a different aspect of patient care) seamlessly. Creating automatic workflows is one answer to this, and once the workflows move from one organization to the partner organization, progress can be fast. There is great progress with the data layer, and once this problem with the workflow layer is completely eradicated, there would be a rapid exchange of information and output. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a new rule on February 22, 2019, concerning the many programs that CMS manages. According to the rule, patients can access their health information on  . The patient’s health information, including their health plans and providers, complete with history of illnesses will all be shared. The payers here, mostly insurance providers that offer QHPs or Qualified Health Plans, have massive information about patients that would be really helpful to the providers. But so far, they have been slow in cooperating with the healthcare providers, and some of them do not want to share their data at all. That has to change. Hopefully, with the new rules, there will be a change in that soon. Once that happens the payers would have to maintain open APIs to enable third-party applications to quickly retrieve patient health data (with approval from patients, of course) and adjudicated claims data, clinical data, provider directory data and so on. There is no doubt that there should be standardization in health IT standards, and even the stakeholders agree on that but it is the way these standards are interpreted and enforced that makes all the difference. There are various interoperability standards that stand as a challenge to interoperability advancement. The ecosystem is so different in today’s healthcare industry. You can see a patient at the clinic, hospital, in hospices and even through online consultation. So care is happening in multiple venues. If there is a lack of interoperability standards, then it makes data exchange difficult or limited.\xa0 This can be solved by having a network where the healthcare exchange between all providers and organizations that promote interoperability uses software that’s already embedded into the provider’s EHR system. This will cut out the standardization problems and facilitate exchanges. However, following the same standards is still a limiting factor, but that should be cleared with time. One of the biggest barriers in interoperability is the inability to match the patient with the records. Errors could happen at any point, right when the patient fills out his forms to the point of care. It is obvious that one small error can really bring the whole thing down and because there are no actual people, once it goes through different systems, the errors may not even be detected. Inaccuracies, inconsistencies and incomplete forms can pose real problems in actual matching. This makes comparing a particular patient’s information across other health records a tough task. Following certain common practices for identifying demographic data, developing a public-private collaboration effort and sharing best practices are a few ways in which these discrepancies can be avoided. There are new interoperability movement initiatives springing up every now and then. Government agencies need some kind of uniform method to measure the progress of these initiatives. This would help in the assessment of health IT interoperability in a consistent way. But sometimes, interoperability measurement standards can vary among the stakeholders too. And some of the older measurements can also pose confusion. Some of these are Health Level 7 standards, International Classification of Disease, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), OpenEHR, CEN/ISO EN13606 and so on. Healthcare institutes do not always conform to a single standard, and the use of more than one standard can definitely lead to serious errors. One way to overcome this problem would be having a uniform measurement framework - Interoperability Standards Measurement Framework. Through this framework, the industry’s activities in implementing interoperability standards would be analyzed, and measured in detail. This would help track the progress on a national scale. Through this framework, the healthcare IT professionals/companies are required to report the following: the percentage of end-users following a particular standard, what are the number of transactions that happen according to these particular standards and after implementation, record the conformation and customization of those standards. The main aim of interoperability is to bring together everyone related to healthcare sectors. This can be started by encouraging the medical professionals to use common medical terminology while creating patient health records (so there won’t be mismatches), coordinating the stakeholders in the medical industry because they really do have to collaborate on creating policies and standards in enforcing interoperability, and cut out the staff workflow issues completely. It is imperative for all healthcare facilities to adopt interoperability because that’s the only way in which they can reach their goal: provide comprehensive diagnosis, treatment and care to the patient. Having patient data at their fingertips would enable healthcare professionals to provide healthcare without delays. And since the data comes in through various levels as mentioned above, those factors have to be considered as well. Just like there are two sides to a coin, if there are several advantages to achieving interoperability among healthcare systems, the barriers that we mentioned above will also have to be considered. A huge change in this scenario will also come if the hospitals and clinics begin to consider the patient's medical records as not their own property, but that of the patients.\xa0 ", "Data fabric is a new enterprise data solution, and the first real evolution of data since the relational database appeared in the 1970s. It uses a network-based architecture to handle information using connections instead of copies, an approach similar to that of the human brain. This interwoven structure is where the term “fabric” comes from, though it would also be accurate to call it a true data network.\xa0 It is this approach that allows   to replace point-to-point integration with universal access controls, eliminating data copying, promoting collaborative intelligence, ending data silos, and creating meaningful data ownership arguably for the first time since the invention of digitized data. This makes it an important technology for these times, when policies like the GDPR seek to codify the protection of data privacy.\xa0 All of these attributes convey some key benefits to the enterprise architect who chooses data fabric, including faster IT delivery times, reusable and autonomous data, and the capacity for actually increasing efficiency over time.  is the newest evolution of data. Let's explore what it entails before moving further. Because data fabric relies on universal access instead of copies, it allows for meaningful data ownership for the first time ever. At a basic level, the purpose of data fabric is to provide a better way to handle enterprise data. It does this by replacing copies with controlled access, and by providing a method for separating data from the applications that create it. This approach restores control to data owners while actually making it easier to share data with collaborators. This is a revolutionary accomplishment. Over the entire history of data, the easier it became to share data the harder it became to have meaningful ownership over it. This trend really came to a head over the past several decades, where the internet and cloud technology made it possible to instantly spread countless copies of data. Sure this made it easy to share things, but how can you own something when there’s ten thousand copies of it? Data fabric is relatively new, and there are many solutions being offered under the name data fabric. However, only a handful of solutions are what you can consider to be true data fabric technology. Here are the components you should look for when choosing a solution: By definition, a data fabric must be designed as a network. It is this network-based design that forms the foundation for everything else a data fabric can deliver. Furthermore, the data fabric should take advantage of this network structure to offer universal access controls for your data.\xa0 If you’re familiar with setting permissions in a cloud-based productivity suite, you understand the basic premise here. Instead of sharing copies of data, you’re setting permissions for users to access your single source. A data fabric should allow you to control these permissions at the data level, meaning you can set data permissions once, instead of on an app-by-app basis. Because these controls are embedded at the data level, they will exist wherever that data appears. For example, you can give the Marketing Team permission to see client email addresses. You set this permission once, and any time a client’s email address appears as a dataset it will be viewable by the Marketing Team. This cuts hours of work from managing data permissions. The networked design and data-level permissions eliminate the need to copy data from app to app and perform integration projects. This further reduces the time and cost of building new tech, while setting the stage for meaningful data ownership and privacy. Until now, data has always been tied to the application that created it. This is the root problem behind the current dependence on copying data and performing costly integration projects. Data fabric offers the ability to separate data from the application, creating   – data that exists independently and can be accessed by multiple applications without requiring point-to-point integration efforts. This autonomous data has a number of uses and makes for an incredibly efficient way to build new solutions. Think of the way APIs allow you to reuse code for new applications – data fabric should allow you to reuse data in a similar fashion. New tech can leverage data that’s already on the fabric, so the solution you created for X can easily be adapted to Y without having to rebuild key components.\xa0 Autonomous data also gives you the ability to easily add new features and capabilities to legacy systems. These projects can traditionally be very frustrating, as even the ones that “should be simple” tend to be anything but because of legacy systems’ rigid and brittle architecture. Working with a data fabric, it becomes much easier to “teach your old dogs new tricks” by augmenting existing applications with new capabilities. Data fabric represents an end to the familiar (but highly inefficient) buy/build/integrate paradigm. Creating solutions on a data fabric should cut build times in half simply by eliminating the need to carry out point-to-point integration projects, and it can offer additional benefits from there. Plasticity is the ability to reshape and reorganize existing information in a more efficient manner. It’s what lets your brain handle more data than any company on the planet—it constantly self-optimizes to make more efficient connections between the things you learn. In fact, studies have shown that a high IQ score correlates with having fewer such connections. Currently, point-to-point integration means that your data architecture has the maximum amount of connections possible… which would make for a very low IQ score. Data plasticity means that these connections can be streamlined to create actual intelligence for the enterprise. This has never been meaningfully replicated in machine data before.\xa0 For enterprises, plasticity eliminates barriers that limit schema evolution. Builders can create integrations via data contracts (i.e. models) to prevent integrations from breaking as the data fabric schema evolves over time. This allows you to change your data schema without breaking any internal or external dependencies, including relationships to and from other tables, APIs, or queries. By enabling the evolution of schema, the data model is free to evolve similarly to how the human brain continually adapts as it takes on new information. Meaningful data ownership is vital to protecting personal privacy and enterprise security, and can be viewed as a foundational step for entering the hyper-intensive data future of AI/ML, IoT, and other emerging technology. As such, there’s been a recent push from lawmakers to create and enforce data ownership regulations. But every integration project means new copies of data, and today’s enterprises can have thousands of data copies to manage. With so many data copies, there’s really no such thing as “data ownership.” Any attempts to control data, including the GDPR and other such legislation, are thus a moot point until data copying has been curbed and data ownership has actual meaning. Data is only as secure as its most vulnerable copy, and any attempt to guarantee control over data without first doing something about all these copies is like attempting to control the value of currency without doing anything about counterfeiting.\xa0 By virtue of its ability to eliminate copies and control access, data fabric should provide an ideal platform for establishing and enforcing meaningful data ownership. Metadata is data about the data, and it’s the key to unlocking most of the magic of a data fabric. Traditional metadata is inactive, severely limiting its usefulness. A data fabric makes this metadata active, meaning that it is updated in real time and can be queried, analyzed, and otherwise interacted with just like traditional data. This is where the true power of a data fabric comes from. By activating metadata, it becomes possible to have universal data operations and streamline the whole end-to-end process of managing data and changing data and structures. It is this activated metadata that allows for standardized governance and a universal data API, which are key ingredients of the data fabric. And because active metadata is updated in real time, you can change data-capture events to connect both upstream and downstream sources into the fabric. In other words, it is this activated metadata that allows for the vital component of plasticity in your data fabric architecture. As a whole, active metadata facilitates data management in an intuitive way. This is the very essence of data fabric technology.\xa0 A true data fabric should have the capacity to replace traditional applications with experiences powered entirely by metadata. For the end user these experiences will be indistinguishable from an API or app, but creating them is as simple as working with data in a spreadsheet. Fully fledged metadata-driven experiences require a fairly mature data fabric with a robust assortment of connected data sources, making them a future state technology. But the foundations for these experiences should exist in any current tech calling itself a data fabric. Namely, the ability to use active metadata in such a way that it replaces the need for coding in the traditional sense. These metadata driven experiences promise to reshape the way solutions are built in the future, giving more power to the data owners and allowing business users to create custom data solutions without involving IT resources. The benefits of this are plentiful, from faster build times to easily personalized solutions. Imagine giving your team members the ability to create their own customized solutions for working with their data, even if they have no technical ability beyond working in a spreadsheet or SQL – that’s exactly what these metadata-driven experiences promise to do.\xa0 Perhaps the most promising benefit of a true data fabric is the capacity for network effects. This is a phenomenon where a network becomes more efficient and more effective as more nodes are connected. The first telephone, for example, was pretty pointless until the invention of the second telephone, and it only got better as more and more phones were networked together. Data fabric delivers this same result for enterprise data; the more data that already exists on the fabric, the easier it is to leverage towards new solutions. This is a direct 180 from today’s model of point-to-point integration, where projects become more complicated and more costly over time.\xa0 With a true data fabric, the more you use it, the more efficient it will become. Data fabric software offers a number of benefits. It makes build times significantly faster, powering digital transformation efforts. It allows for low-code and no-code solutions, giving data owners and other business users the ability to solve problems without taking up valuable IT resources (if someone can work with spreadsheets or SQL, they can create APIs via a data fabric). Data fabric eliminates data copying, forming the foundation for meaningful data ownership. This helps future-proof solutions ahead of new data privacy laws, which are being introduced regularly. Data fabric introduces the compounding efficiency of network effects for data. The more you work with your data fabric, the more effective and efficient it becomes. This gives tremendous competitive advantage to early data fabric adopters. Data fabric has a low cost of entry. There is no downtime from standing up a new fabric, simply pick an existing project and use your new data fabric to build the solution. It will exist in tandem with your legacy systems, and grow organically as you use it for future projects. Data fabric technology is often compared to data virtualization technology, and both offer innovative ways for handling enterprise data. But there’s an important difference between the two: data virtualization simulates change, while data fabric offers real change to the physical structure of your data. It’s the difference between putting on VR goggles to take a virtual tour of the Grand Canyon, and actually being there. Data fabric is very much real. Major enterprises in global finance and other data-heavy industries are already relying on it to revolutionize the way they handle their data. And their early reactions are extremely positive. Data fabric allows these corporations to create solutions faster than ever before possible, and to do so while eliminating data copies and protecting data privacy to create meaningful data ownership. Data fabric is a promising new technology that has the potential to end the buy-build-integrate paradigm that’s dominated enterprise IT for the past 40+ years. But because data fabric technology is so new, it’s important to understand what critical components and capabilities make up a true data fabric platform. Look for a solution that offers a data network, autonomous data, active metadata, and the other benefits outlined here, and you’ll be sure you’re getting the real deal. You’ll have everything you need for your new, data-centric approach to the enterprise architecture. ", 'Health data is the lifeblood of the medical industry. It’s also currency in the world of hackers, as clearly seen in the 2017 Wannacry   attack. Patient information is, by nature, sensitive, and health insurance claims are common  . Hospitals and medical practices depend on PHI to understand a patient’s medical history to add context to a person’s health. But they also need to learn and implement the proper safeguards to ensure that stored PHI is not compromised.  is identifiable patient information stored and shared electronically. ePHI refers to data that a medical professional collects and stores to determine and provide proper care. Eighteen specific identifiers of patient demographics are considered PHI according to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). They include: Some examples of ePHI include:  set the standard for the creation, storage, transmission and receipt of ePHI. The HIPAA Security Rule specifies that health care-related providers, vendors, and IT companies follow standards to restrict unauthorized access to PHI. The HIPAA Security Rule helps maintain the confidentiality to prevent illegal disclosure, integrity required to authorize and authenticate use by medical personnel, and availability that allows patient access of ePHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule guides how health care organizations use and share PHI, with patients when necessary, as well as limits which PHI health care organizations can collect from patients, share with other organizations or use as marketing material. What, then, does not qualify as ePHI in the digital age? ePHI is only considered “protected information” when, 1) it is maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity or business associate, and 2) it can identify a specific individual. That means that health information stored in school or employment records is not ePHI, nor is the professional information of medical staff. Additionally, patient health data can be completely stripped of identifiers (those mentioned above). If that data is stripped of identifiers, it is no longer protected information and HIPAA’s restrictions on use and disclosure no longer apply. That stripped data is referred to as de-identified or anonymized data and can be added to databases and ultimately provide insight into general populations and value care-based programs. Additionally, consider the existence of Apple Health Records, glucose trackers, heart rate monitors and even period trackers. Health apps abound and they collect information that could very well be classified as ePHI. However, that data doesn’t fall under HIPAA rules because the app wasn’t created for the use of a physician. A patient’s own knowledge of their health data doesn’t fall under HIPAA either. They’re free to share their own information to their heart’s desire. Determining what data is or isn’t considered ePHI is tricky. Context can always help accurately identify ePHI and prevent patients from inadvertently violating HIPAA. ePHI must be protected in your organization, whether you are a covered entity or a business associate. After all, ePHI noncompliance can result in employee termination or civil and criminal penalties. “Covered entities” are health care providers, health insurance clearinghouses and health plans. “Business associates” are businesses that provide services to and in partnership with covered entities. This includes software developers who create programs and apps for the health care industry, and hospital data storage providers. If you don’t have safeguards in place to ensure patient privacy, conduct an audit to assess what level of security your organization has. Risk assessments will uncover any gaps, identify where ePHI is stored and detail the current flow of information. You can then create recovery plans to address any vulnerabilities and weaknesses, implement solutions that will help maintain security, and standardize ePHI storage and transmission. Swedish Covenant Hospital nurse Justine Lee (BSN, RN) witnessed what can happen when medical staff are implicated in an ePHI noncompliance scandal. After actor Jussie Smollett was indicted for lying to police, about 80 medical professionals at Northwestern Memorial Hospital were swiftly fired when it was determined they had improperly viewed Smollett’s medical records. Once Smollett acknowledged he had lied about being attacked, a lawsuit was filed, and as a result, his medical records were audited. At Northwestern Memorial, whenever a hospital employee opened a patient file, the employee’s name is recorded, along with the date and time. The audit revealed practitioners who had no line of care to Smollett viewed his files, a clear HIPAA violation. “HIPAA protects patient medical information from the moment they make an appointment or get admitted, to the bills they pay, to the outpatient services they do,” Lee said. “Anyone who isn’t directly involved with that patient is looking into medical information illegally.” Lee explained there’s a blurred line when it comes to looking at patient files. In some scenarios, HIPAA allows medical professionals to access or restrict patient information, even without consent. But that’s only if it’s considered the best way to keep their health information private and safe. For example, Lee recalls the need for ICU nurses to look at the files of emergency room patients before they’ve officially arrived at the ICU, so they’re prepared for the incoming admission. \xa0 '], 51: ['Few things are better in life than jumping onto a Boeing 737 and flying away from whatever’s haunting you at home. That’s right folks, I’m talking about travel. Travel can become pretty expensive rather quickly, but there are a few tricks to help afford a getaway here and there. One of those tricks? Picking out the right travel credit card for your needs.\xa0 Choosing the right credit card for travel depends on what you want most out. Points? Perks? Frequent flier miles? In this article, I’m going to walk you through some of the best options on the market. Wait a second, aren’t credit cards designed to make you  money? How can they help you save? Well, you’re right. Credit card companies want you to spend money, as they get a kickback from each purchase you make. However, many will incentivize that spend with points or perks. This is especially true of travel credit cards. These cards can get you free checked baggage with certain airlines, or access to members-only lounges. The following credit cards are considered by experts as some of the best for frequent flyers. This card offers an introductory bonus of 20,000 miles (after spending $1,000 in the first three months of card ownership).

It depends on what you consider the most valuable asset. Some will want the ability to plop down in various airport lounges, while others just want a boost to help them take that dream vacation. Whatever card you choose, take me with you! ', "Suppose you are receiving invoices from various suppliers and see that your purchase order software does not have any record of the purchases made. This means that you are not sure whether to pay them or not. When you're working in the accounts payable department, it is obvious that you'll understand the pain. In that case, you have to reach out employees working in other departments and have to chase them to get the correct information. Making calls and sending emails may not always be helpful. Instead, you will have to go personally to their desk and ask questions. Your task gets difficult when you have to figure out what are the items purchased and by whom, if those orders were authorized, do you need to pay invoices, and more. Accounts payable problems mainly take place because of the unorganized processes. We have gone through and listed out the following accounts payable errors to help you better understand and identify them. Entering data inaccurately is one of the biggest issues of accounts payable. It is difficult to track employees who haven’t exchanged a PO number or the amount payable while entering data manually in the software. When your organization has to essentially rely on entering data manually for invoice payment or in order to create purchase orders, errors are bound to crop up. Did you ever pay an invoice before receiving the receipt of a product? During busy days, accounts payable staff may, at times,   even before receiving them. They do not confirm whether the product or the service has been delivered properly or not. At times, suppliers send second invoice if their first invoice does not get processed. So, now you have two invoices for the same product maybe one on your desk and the other one misplaced inside your files. So, it is obvious that you have to pay for both invoices. Manually processing invoices is a cumbersome task and takes a lot of time. With an automated accounts payable system, average invoice processing per employee increase more than 5 times. So, if an accounts payable department can process 1000 invoices manually every month, then automating AP process can increase the number more than 5000 per AP employee.\xa0 Missing a due date and not paying on time is the most common problem that AP departments face. While you are working with the suppliers, they expect their payments on time. They may feel annoyed when you keep on telling them that unfortunately you have lost the invoice, or missed the due date. Continuous late payments lead to receiving late fees which make hole in your budget. When your supplier is not happy, they may cut ties with your organization if there is no solution to late payments. The following four tips can help with minimizing the above accounts payable errors.

It becomes easier for you to suspect any kind of wrong entries with an online AP system that turns troubleshooting a breeze.\xa0 You must be able to view the entire accounts payable process starting from who ordered which product, who signed after deliveries, who matched the items, and who made the payment for invoices. You can simply do it without making repetitive phone calls or sending emails multiple times. This way you will have everything at your fingertips that you need to resolve a problem along with knowing your point of contact if there is any question to ask. Receiving granular insights makes your work easier without worrying about audits. If you are tracking accounts payable for some days, then you will find few trends recurring in payment scheduling. You can predict monthly and annual trends and generate cash flow management accurately such as at which time of the month you are spending cash often or which categories in accounts payable fluctuate the most. Identifying the trouble areas enables you to plan them in a better way so you have a good amount of cash with you in order to meet your requirements. This is the act of investigating shipping orders, purchase orders (PO), and invoices in order to check the amount and quantity are same and whether the procurement transaction is legal. Any kind of deviation is alarming and could signal possibilities of fraudulent activities or errors while ordering and following up.

So, if you are successful in resolving the above accounts payable problems, there is no need to worry about delayed or missed payments. At the same time, you can also maintain a good relationship with your vendors and your business will make most rebates on large volumes of purchases made.\xa0 ", 'Our digital world has made it easier to do business across borders and around the globe.\xa0 But there are still barriers when it comes to making payments and transferring money through traditional modes. Here’s a look at the landscape for global payments, and how digital payments are making it easier to pay and get paid. How does a marketing company in the United States pay a contract designer in Pakistan? How can a textile manufacturer in Vietnam transfer funds to a silk supplier in India?\xa0 As companies participate in the global economy, the question of how to pay and get paid becomes a relevant one. Transfers take longer, are subject to currency exchange, and can be difficult to trace as they navigate through different banking institutions. Businesses need quicker, more reliable means to send and receive money. Digital payments have risen to prominence as the best solution for sending and reviewing money across borders. Here’s a look at what they are, how they work and how they stack up against traditional modes of  . Digital payments are aptly named. These are   a business can execute and process using digital resources. Digital payments can be point-to-point or travel through any number of intermediaries to get to their destination. Regardless of the journey, there’s no physical transfer of cash involved. A very simple example of a digital payment would be an e-commerce purchase. When you put your credit card details into a website and check out online, payment occurs without any physical transfer of funds. While simple on the surface, digital payments are incredibly complex in their execution. This is because financial transaction data needs absolute security. Digital payments are only as secure as the platforms that process and handle them – which is to say, extremely secure. Reputable payment processors use various forms of encryption, standardized by organizations such as the   Security Standards Council. Digital payments are the next step forward in global payments. Because they’re processed without cash, in real time, they’re accommodating to any person or business, anywhere in the world. As world economies become increasingly interconnected, the need for businesses to pay vendors, partners, workers and organizations in other countries will only grow. Unfortunately, there are still obstacles that make it difficult to move money across borders. Digital payments solve many of the physical barriers associated with global payments, including: The bottom line is that businesses are going digital, and they need a payments solution that matches the technologies they’re already using. In the same way they might share a digital file through the cloud or jump on a video conference with someone across the globe, businesses want the ability to send and receive money with fewer barriers. The way digital payments work varies from provider to provider. Generally, providers rely on payment networks to leverage payment rails, and users send money from a straightforward, intuitive payment platform.\xa0 Payment rails are the different processing modes for cashless payments. Different rails can include cards, bank accounts, the SWIFT network, blockchain, and more. The process is simple and straightforward. After you sign up with a digital payment provider, you’ll choose the mode of payment you want to use. You’ll also need information for the recipient. Often, this is as simple as entering an email. The digital payment provider handles the rest. After you send funds, the digital payment provider executes the transfer through the applicable rail. Because everything happens digitally, you have the ability to see the status of the transaction in real time. When the transfer is complete and funds have landed, the recipient can manage their funds however they want – whether that means transfer to a bank account or into a digital wallet. There are several tailwinds pushing adoption of digital payments. Most pressing is the fact that the SWIFT system, which handles the bulk of cross border payments, was built for a different era. The rise of e-commerce, global supply chains, and the gig economy has made   more prevalent.\xa0 An expanding global marketplace demands more optionality from payment providers. This all added up to major demands for simpler, more efficient, more affordable global payments. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is a global network of banking institutions. Its purpose is to send and receive financial transaction data across borders. It’s important to note that SWIFT isn’t responsible for funds transfer – it merely facilitates payment orders.\xa0 It’s up to banks within the swift network to settle funds. These transfers aren’t always efficient, and there’s a lack of transparency in how they’re handled. For example, companies sending international payments through the SWIFT network aren’t always privy to the exchange rates on currency. As global commerce increases, so does demand for more efficiency and transparency in global payments. Businesses need comprehensive tools that allow them to communicate with their partners, and compensate their vendors, contractors and merchants. This could mean sending money to multiple countries, in various landed currencies, in different intervals. Businesses need more support than the SWIFT network and traditional banks can provide. They’re turning to digital payments to enable more seamless transfer of funds. Cloud tools, coupled with the rise in remote work positions, have made it possible to tap into a global talent pool of contractors. You can hire a programmer from Israel, a web developer from the Philippines, a graphic artist from Italy and a 3D modeler from Japan – all while working from your office in New York, London, or anywhere else in the world. Gig workers are flexible, accessible, and ready to work, no matter where they are. As companies increasingly turn to gig workers, they need reliable ways to pay these individuals. Digital payments have quickly risen to the top of the options list because of the benefits they offer. Real-time payments, payment tracking, and the ability to pay unbanked contractors are all major factors that enable digital payments. Plus, the nature of digital wallets makes it easy to overcome currency exchange barriers inherent to a distributed workforce. Doing business in the global marketplace is more complex than doing business at home. Without access to the resources large corporations have, globalization has traditionally been out of reach for most small businesses and startups.\xa0 But with rapid technological advancements in global payments, anyone can access the powerful tools it takes to compete (and win!) in the global marketplace. Smaller businesses are able to be competitive thanks to innovations that save time and money. Digital payments help small businesses get a leg up on finding international suppliers, contractors, services, customers, and more. By eliminating the middleman for payments, digital payment providers have leveled the playing field as the world transitions to one big economy. When talking about digital payments, it’s important to note that there are several types to consider. A digital payment is a transaction without cash. As companies think about , they need to carefully consider which type of global payment is most applicable to their situation. Here’s a look at five types of digital payments and the pros and cons that come with them. The simplest and   is via a credit or debit card. Almost every business has one, and they’re regularly issued in conjunction with other banking products such as checking accounts.\xa0 Businesses can use cards in a variety of different ways, including swiping or inserting at terminals, entering the 16-digit code into a   or even reading the card number over the phone. Card transactions are best for small businesses paying for goods and/or services through secure merchant portals, and only through mediums with  .\xa0 Local payments actually refer to the banking institutions that process payments. Local payment rails like an automated clearing house (ACH) are great tools for sending large sums of money from one business to another.\xa0 This mode of digital payment is highly secure and actually requires very little information outside of routing and account numbers. The downfall is that these institutions offer little visibility into the status or workings of payments. There are costs and time involved in sending and landing a cross-border payment.\xa0 Checks are still a commonly used method of payments for many enterprise-level businesses. And while we tend to think of checks as physical paper payments, digital checks are now common. Digital check payments act just like their physical counterparts, which means recipients can deposit them at a bank or use third-party tools to cash them.\xa0 These payments are a short jump from physical paper checks and leave a similar digital paper trail. Digital checks are easy to disburse and account for, making them a preferred method when paying vendors.\xa0 Wallets are “pure” digital payments, meaning they don’t rely on any sort of institutional bank account or line of credit. Digital payment platforms host wallets and facilitate funds transfers between other wallets and traditional bank accounts. Wallet payments occur quickly and it’s easy for businesses and payees to see the transfer of funds in real time.\xa0 There’s very little information required to execute digital wallet payments – often just an email address or a wallet ID number. Moreover, wallets can hold funds in any currency, which eliminates one of the biggest barriers in cross-border payments. Wire transfers are the common way to send money around the world through traditional banking institutions. Businesses can send a wire transfer through any bank that’s part of the SWIFT network, and many third-party wire services as well. Sending money through a wire incurs a fee (set by the provider) that’s usually rather high. Moreover, because wire transfers occur through the SWIFT network, there’s very little transparency from Point A to Point B.\xa0 Cryptocurrency isn’t what you’d call a “common” digital payment option, but its rapid rise to prominence makes it worth the mention. Blockchain-backed coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Dogecoin are gaining steam as viable currency.\xa0 Paying global partners in crypto takes some doing – you and your recipient will need digital wallets that accept crypto assets. There are also tax and reporting implications to consider, which aren’t fully clarified by domestic or international revenue agencies. Safe to say that cryptocurrency is on the global payments radar, but not quite a prominent player yet.\xa0 There are more ways than ever to send money around the world. Whether you’re paying a contractor in Spain, ordering from a vendor in China or receiving funds from a partner in Brazil, it’s important to consider how that money moves across borders. Do you send a digital check? Wire the money? Send payment between two digital wallets? The answer depends on the context of the payment. No matter how they choose to send payment, one thing is certain: more and more businesses are looking for ways to transfer money internationally. The good news is, there’s an abundance of tools out there to help them do it. From SWIFT and ACH transfers, to digital wallets and checks, to credit cards and even cryptocurrency, businesses have options.\xa0 In today’s global, digital age, modern businesses need the ability to send and receive money across borders. Digital global payments allow them to do it efficiently, transparently and affordably. The result is a global economy that continues to get bigger and grow stronger.\xa0 '], 39: ['When it comes to differentiating different compliance terms, the key is in the details. There’s a lot of differing terminology within compliance. Different industries use different terms and they all answer to different agencies. But even with all these differences, some terms can seem a little too similar upon first glance. In this article, we’ll look at regulatory compliance, how it differs from corporate compliance, and why you need it as part of your overall compliance strategy. Regulatory compliance is when a corporation follows state, federal, and international laws regarding its operations. It’s one part of the overall  . Depending on your industry, the nature of the regulatory compliance you’ll face will vary. Some industries like healthcare and finance are subject to rigorous legislation, while other industries only have a few governing bodies to answer to. The end goal of regulatory compliance is to give consumers the confidence they need when interacting with a business or purchasing a product. The consumer wants to feel as though the business they choose to interact with is following the law and practice adequate  , and compliance measures allow them to do that. On the surface, it may seem like regulatory compliance and   are interchangeable; but that’s not the case. While the two are very similar there is one key difference that separates them. The key difference is the requirement by law. Corporate compliance can vary from business to business because the regulations are set for the business by the business themselves. Oftentimes, a company will fold regulatory compliance requirements into their existing corporate compliance plan to streamline the process, but it’s not required. Aside from the obvious importance of following the law, why else is regulatory compliance important? Here are just three reasons you need to make compliance a priority: Regulatory compliance isn’t something you can ignore in hopes that it’ll work itself out. The law is constantly changing and those changes impact the way we do business. Keeping your finger on the pulse of regulatory compliance will help you stay ahead of your competitors and ahead of any potential fines that might come your way. Speaking of fines. Within the last year, you’ve probably seen the stories of corporate data breaches that have cost companies millions of dollars in penalties and fines. If you think those astronomical numbers are reserved for corporate giants, you’d be wrong. According to research done by  , the cost of corporate data and privacy breaches continues to rise. The cost of a compliance violation isn’t based on the size of your company. It’s based on the severity of what your company did. That means even small businesses could be subject to large financial penalties if they don’t maintain regulatory compliance. Despite what you may think, compliance doesn’t exist to be a buzz-kill. The regulations and laws set in place are there to protect everyone involved. Compliance protects the consumer from purchasing unregulated products or doing business with shady companies. It also protects businesses from making preventable mistakes that could cost them money or endanger their employees. The short answer: it depends on your industry and where you’re located. There are countless organizations that oversee compliance. Regulatory compliance operates like the government, in that there are both state and federal laws and agencies. In some cases, there are international governing bodies that also weigh in on regulatory compliance. The federal government alone has nearly   on record that oversee different industries in some capacity. Those aren’t even including the various legislative measures that have been passed over the years to supplement various governing bodies. Technology is digitizing everything. The days of being able to securely lock your important documents away in a filing cabinet are gone. Innovations in technology are changing the regulatory compliance landscape faster than most people can keep up. There’s a lot that goes into regulatory compliance, which is why many companies invest in  . That’s why products like   are important for regulatory compliance.

Because of this, it’s crucial for any business to follow the standards set in place by the   that best represents their industry.

In business, there are two types of audits that can be confused for each other: a compliance audit and an internal audit. The confusion stems from the fact that they may be conducted by the same person, but they review different aspects of your business. It’s important to keep in mind that an internal audit will gauge how well an organization follows its own internal codes of conduct and formal process. On the other hand, a compliance audit will evaluate how well an organization follows outside laws and regulations that cover various industries. If you want your company to remain profitable and in business for the long term, then knowing rules and regulations in the compliance audits that apply to your industry is a must. Learn more about each type of audit and how   can help make staying compliant that much easier. Everyone wants to think their business is the best… and some are.

While yes, some businesses really do offer the best of something, if no one is checking what actually is  , there’s nothing besides word-of-mouth to prevent a business from claiming they offer the best service, product, or solution on the market. Because most small businesses operate on a smaller scale, there’s less of a threat to their customers than larger businesses. However, what would happen if a large business like Google or Amazon didn’t meet the proper security standards, leaving millions – or even billions – of customers at risk. Compliance auditing is important because if you don’t at least meet the basic standards, you open your business and all of its customers up to massive problems.

The DSS portion of this audit, Data Security Standard, are the regulations being placed on anyone who has to follow PCI compliance. In 2006, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express (AMEX) established the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSS) to help regulate the credit card industry and establish clear operating guidelines for how consumer credit card information should be handled. These standards apply to any organization that processes payment cards or creates the infrastructure to process payments. If your company neglects to adhere to these rules and regulations, you could receive a fine of up to $100,000 per month of noncompliance. SOC 2 is a compliance audit defined by the AICPA (The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) and is a common compliance standard for modern technology companies. It mainly applies to service providers who store customer data in the cloud. SOC 2 requires these companies to be compliant as they follow strict policies and procedures set in place to protect this private information. To achieve SOC 2 compliance, most companies prepare themselves for anywhere from six months to a year, including identifying the scope of the audit for their businesses, developing policies and procedures, and putting new security controls in place to reduce risks.

Because of this, both your finance and IT departments need to work together to align their efforts and processes to ensure everything is within the standards. For example, IT departments are required to properly store and manage corporate records. The rules require that there’s no tampering with regulated documents and that they’re properly encrypted and securely stored using the same guidelines as public accountants. From a financial and management perspective, SOX requires that management teams take responsibility for their own financial records and that specific financial disclosures are made to shareholders, including off-balance-sheet transactions and stock transactions of executives. If not, the result could be major penalties for the CEO and CFO of your organization. The ISO (International Organization of Standardization) compliance audit is part of the ISO/IEC 27K Series and is an information security compliance standard that helps companies manage the security of assets, such as employee or third-party data, financial information, and intellectual property. Like SOC 2, the audit involves a risk management process that includes people, processes, and technology. Both standards require that an independent auditor assess a company’s security controls to ensure it's mitigating risks properly. ISO works with over 160 countries to regulate industry standards as a way to align business practices and resolve any issues that may arise regarding equipment or processes. One thing to remember about ISO is there’s a difference between being ISO compliant and ISO certified. To be considered ISO compliant, your organization has yet to undergo a formal certification audit. In order to be ISO certified, you will have to undergo a longer auditing process by a third-party who will evaluate your adherence to all ISO standards. While being certified is voluntary, doing so helps your business increase customer trust and satisfaction. The EU’s general data protection regulation ( ) is one of the most comprehensive government-imposed data privacy frameworks implemented to date.

A successful compliance program will be able to zero in on a compliance issue and stop it before anything bad happens.   is a key part of this step. Risk prevention is different from identification in one key way. The focus of prevention is to design and implement controls to protect an organization from those identifiable risks. These measures are put in place to act as a fail-safe for something a compliance officer might miss at first. Risk monitoring is exactly what it sounds like. A corporate compliance team will track, analyze, and monitor potential risks to the company and report of the effectiveness of the controls set in place to manage them.

Even the best compliance team will deal with unforeseen compliance risks every now and again.

Risk advisory is focused on training and advising businesses on the rules, controls, and regulations set in place to keep them compliant.

That means having regular one-on-one meetings with them where they have dedicated time to talk about anything that's happening in their life or their work. I'm there to listen and do my best to understand their perspective, and then to work with them to figure out how to remove any roadblocks they face. It was really difficult to learn this lesson at first because we managers like to control meetings. But the impact of that dedicated time for active listening has been tremendous.”   , Director of  , says “Miscommunication causes more issues – issues between staff, issues between patients and staff, issues between patient and practitioner, issues between the practice and its vendors – that eat up valuable time, energy, and other resources. Clear, concise, and usually multiple means of communication can eliminate a lot of headaches and unfortunate events. Whether it's a whiteboard and sticky notes, or emails, texts, and phone calls, having a system in place to ensure that everyone who needs to get the message does. It’s vital to a happy, healthy, thriving business. We save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year simply by effectively communicating with each other and our patients.”   , Marketing Manager at  , says “As with many other startups, everyone on our team has to wear many different hats. I think the key to becoming a good manager with a smaller team is figuring out skillsets that your co-workers might not have known they possessed. If your social media guru also has a knack for image editing, then you can tackle two big projects at once. Figuring out, encouraging, and nurturing hidden talents is instrumental for our team.”   , Founder & CEO of  , says “For myself, the best manager development I received was by surrounding myself with great managers, seeking feedback from them, and doing the things that you wished your managers did now and from managers past. Above all, is to have empathy. The best leaders and managers have empathy and focus on building relationships, building trust, and are not afraid to have tough yet candid conversations with their employees. These are things that no podcast or leadership book can teach you. You have to practice them and seek feedback.”   , Chief Marketing Officer at  , says “Accept that there are different ways to get a job done. Everyone has their own style and method to do their job. There are countless ways to write an article, prepare a marketing campaign, etc. Don’t micromanage. Instead, give employees a goal to achieve and let them worry about how they’re going to do it.” , Community Manager at  , says “If you’re a first-time manager, it’s really easy to fall into the trap of wanting to do everything by yourself. This can lead to very poor time management for you and your team, leading to nothing getting done at all, or focusing on low impact tasks. It is, therefore, important to learn to delegate intelligently, and as soon as possible. Delegating responsibilities can be quite challenging as it involves many aspects such as individual strengths, explanation, time allocation, reporting, etc. Balancing all these components is tricky but gets easier with time and experience.” , Marketing Director at  , says “Ultimately, a good manager is judged and valued upon how effective they are in delivering on their responsibilities. This is why they need the support of everyone around them and they need clear priorities on what needs to be delivered. In today's highly-competitive market, it's important to stand out. That means managers should consider doing fewer tasks and achieving them brilliantly, rather than doing many different things averagely.” , HR Manager at  , says “A tip that I have found incredibly useful for gaining backing for top-level ideas is to approach people individually. Say you have to present your idea to the board; I would identify key individuals before the presentation and arrange to talk through some of the ideas with them beforehand. This way, you can preempt concerns and address any issues that they may have. I have found this personable approach goes a long way to gaining trust and support when seeking buy-in for an idea that requires sign off.” , Senior Director of Marketing at  , says “If I had to judge a manager with zero working history I would look at one thing. Their bookshelf. No manager is completely self-taught but I sincerely believe the best managers teach themselves. That starts with reading. A lot.” , a Content Marketing Manager at G2, recommends that aspiring managers read Adam Grant’s  if they're looking to learn more about people interaction. , Ph.D., Professor of Management at  , says “The first thing is to establish trust. Trust is needed so that people trust that the communication is true, that you have their best interests at heart, and that you are willing to listen. Trust is the underpinning of management and leadership. Without it, you fail.” , Founder & CEO of  , says “One of the best habits every good manager and leader should practice is leading from in front. What I mean is, every manager worth their value needs to be ready to get into the mix with work and help out when necessary. When employees see that you're with them as much as in charge of them, it inspires loyalty.”  VP of Brand Marketing at  , says “Managing looked simple from the outside. But being a good manager is not about getting people to do what the company needs. It's about giving your team the tools, the time, and the trust they need to excel. Every person is different. It's your job to understand what every member of your team requires to excel. Honest feedback, effusive encouragement, ideas on how to pitch – and pivot – are all elements in my good manager toolkit.” Good managers will inspire their teams, strengthen their own skill-sets, and embody the company culture. Mastering those three focuses can be challenging, so don’t hesitate to ask for advice from fellow managers, directors, and executives. Learn with your team, grow with your team, and have a lasting impact on your company. Take this article anywhere you go.

There are a couple of reasons why. For starters, everyone wants to feel like they’re being heard. In this day and age, it’s easy to assume that managers, bosses, and anyone in a leadership position first and foremost need to exude confidence. While being assertive and determined are examples of strong  , treating your team with kindness and empathy are just as important (if not more so). Empathy is classified as a “soft skill”, meaning it’s seen as a personal attribute that enables someone to communicate effectively and harmoniously with other people. “Hard skills” are classified as measurable abilities such as reading, math, or efficiency with computer programs. While many companies and team leaders rely heavily on hard skills to get the work done, working to develop soft skills is a quality that can make a world of difference. In this article, we’ll talk about how leading with empathy and kindness can benefit you and your team as well as hear how Zoom CEO, Eric Yuan scaled his company with happiness. Kindness lives at the core of great leadership and empathy is the fuel that keeps the relationships between managers and employees intact. There are a plethora of reasons why you should practice empathy at work every day. Empathy helps to create strong bonds of trust with your employees. It gives crucial insight into how they may be feeling and why they react to a situation in one way or another. Leading a team with empathy and compassion is the best way to give back to the people who do so much for you. Although there are dozens of reasons why using empathy daily is a great way to see your team succeed, we’ll highlight a core three. Have you ever had a bad day? The answer is yes, we all have them. But if you’ve ever been in a bad mood and had someone tell you how much they appreciate you or a task you completed for them, you’ve probably also experienced how great it feels to be told how well you’re doing. Additionally, you’re hit with the urge to continue helping them. This is the power of empathy. Translating this into leadership, giving your employees feedback and keeping open   with them will increase their willingness to work harder. It’s easy for large companies and corporations to miss this tactic so it’s a great way to get a leg up. Great leaders are constantly looking for constructive ways to compliment and encourage their team. People being managed by someone who checks in on them regularly will feel more comfortable at work and ultimately, know that someone cares about them. One of the biggest problems companies face today is a quick employee turnover rate.   reported that 92% of employees said that would be more likely to stay in their job if their bosses would show more empathy. Upper management showing kindness and empathy means more to employees than we think. Showing empathy increases trust and no matter if we’re at home, out with friends, or at work, we’re more likely to stay if we feel like we’re appreciated and understood. Employees that have supportive and understanding management are automatically going to like coming into work, bring a good attitude with them, and take fewer days off. It goes without saying that when a team is happy, they’re more motivated to work together and get the job done. On top of that, they may feel like they have the leeway to be more creative in their work. Employees that feel heard will feel confident that they can find additional ways to bring value to the company. They’ll come up with new ideas and better ways to optimize the workflow, and ultimately, make the entire team’s job easier. At G2 Reach in Chicago, Eric Yuan spoke about how he uses empathy and openness every day and how it helped him to blitz scale  . He approaches life every day simply, reflecting on how he’s feeling. During his session at G2 Reach, Eric highlighted five ways he implements empathy as a CEO. Eric said he often asks his employees if they’re happy. If so, he encourages coming into the office. If not, he sees no need for them to come in. He’d rather them stay home and work on their own happiness. When asked how he brings happiness to his customers, Eric noted that to truly win the customers' heart, you have to start with trust. Zoom aims to keep everything open and transparent between them and their customers. Yuan added that he wants to treat every Zoom user as an extended family member of the company. Focusing on them is they key to great communication. The customers are the center focus for the Zoom team. The Zoom team will look at the negative reviews more than positive ones to make sure they understand the problem and how they can best address it. Eric stressed the importance of customer feedback: Eric also said he likes to respond to negative feedback on Twitter and communicate directly with the customer. He said he’s open to criticism and is always looking to improve the relationship between himself and his customers. Eric said it himself. Zoom has made his life infinitely better. He rarely travels and has more time to spend working on his happiness, keeping true to his work smarter not harder attitude. Yuan says he only travels for business twice a year. Zoom has teams in China, Japan, Kansas City, Austria, and Europe making it super easy and efficient to hold video meetings with international teams instead of having to travel. When asked about keeping his board and fellow executives focused on people when most of them are focused on numbers, Eric stated that it’s his job to choose the investors and executives that care about the people. Eric and his team believe in a healthy work-life balance. While they stress checking in on themselves every day, they still believe in working hard. The Zoom formula reflects how they approach their work: The moral of the story is to check-in, work with compassion, and strive for happiness. Work shouldn’t be a place of hostility. You shouldn’t dread coming in every day. If you go forward with empathy and follow Eric’s five rules, you won’t only become more confident at work, but in yourself. ", 'When it comes to any manager-employee relationship, the manager is always the one who’s in a position of power. How they communicate and behave will influence the level of trust and rapport they can build with each individual on their team. If you’re a manager who’s closed off, it’s likely that your direct reports will be too. However, if you’re a manager who practices vulnerable  , the floodgates will open for some truly amazing conversations. From having a continuous stream of feedback to understanding what truly motivates your team, being vulnerable with your team allows for more open dialogue for all those involved. In this article, we’ll walk through what vulnerable leadership is and how you can best practice it. Let’s get started! For many, vulnerability can be seen as being weak. However, the opposite tends to be true. While being vulnerable can increase your risk of being hurt, emotionally or physically, it also opens up the opportunity to have meaningful conversations that build authentic relationships. In fact,   that social connections benefit our mental and physical health. So why limit these to our personal lives? For leaders looking to practice vulnerability, it’s important to understand that being vulnerable  mean that you need to share your entire life story; waterworks are not a requirement. Rather, it’s about understanding where your strengths and weaknesses lie and being honest about them with not only your team, but yourself too. Strong leaders are self-aware and confident; they understand that they’re not the expert at everything (and they don’t need to be). When leaders feel comfortable enough to lean on their team to fill in any gaps, it’s an act of vulnerability that strengthens the team. That’s because it enables the   person on the team to complete the task at hand rather than the most senior. When leaders ask for help, it’s not a sign of weakness, but rather one of great leadership. They have a deep understanding of the capabilities of each individual on the team. Leading a team is an incredibly tough job that requires a lot of time and focus. In any organization, many leaders are promoted because they  . As a result, they’re promoted to a role where they’re in charge of leading people (with little-to-no-experience). It’s especially important for leaders who are still learning how to lead to be upfront and honest with their team. Leaders, be honest with yourself and with your team. It will make a difference. Vulnerable leadership isn’t just a one time thing, it’s an ongoing process. Here are three ways to practice vulnerable leadership. If you want your team to open up to you, you’ll need to open up first. Remember that you’re in a position of power in the manager-employee relationship, so it can be very intimidating for an employee to open up. As the leader and the person in power, you’re ultimately setting the tone for how you communicate with one another. When you open up, you’re setting the tone of open, honest communication. Opening up doesn’t have to be this big secret revealing process. Instead, it can be as simple as sharing challenges as you face them, as well as things you’re incredibly proud of. Here are some statements to inspire you to open up during your next one-on-one: When you foster a culture of psychological safety, you proactively create a space for team members to feel safe sharing ideas, feedback and generally be themselves in the workplace. In this section, we’ll walk through what psychological safety is, why it matters and how to put it in practice. Originally defined by Amy Edmundson, a Harvard Business School Professor, psychological safety is “a shared belief held by members of a team that [the team culture] is safe for interpersonal risk-taking." She defines it as “a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up.” In a nutshell, psychological safety means that everyone on the team will support and listen to one another in a respectful manner.\xa0 Following the success of  , which determined common behaviors of great managers, Google’s People Innovation Lab wanted to identify the dynamics that made up effective teams. Enter  . In their research, the team at Google found that when it comes to teams, “what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together.” The number one factor on that list? Psychological safety. As Google puts it, “In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.” When everyone on the team puts in the effort to create a psychologically safe space, it allows for open, honest communication. Who doesn’t want that? It’s not something that happens in a day, but rather something that leaders should be doing every single day. Here are three ways in which you can start practicing psychological safety today: A   found that great managers are the single best benefit any company can offer their employees. One of the best ways for managers and employees to continue to work on their relationship is during one-on-one meetings: A dedicated time for managers and their direct reports to discuss anything from motivation and growth to roadblocks and challenges. The chart below breaks down a manager’s role in  : When put in practice, the chart above is an incredible management tool that makes sharing feedback and ideas a no-brainer for employees. Just like we mentioned earlier, when psychological safety is high, it’s easier for your direct reports to open up to you because they feel safe to do so. If you’re not sure how to gauge the level of psychological safety on your team, think about the following: How much effort does a direct report have to put in every time they want to share an idea, a piece of feedback or a challenge they’re facing? If they need to spend a ridiculously long time preparing, both emotionally and in planning how they’ll communicate the feedback, they’re likely not going to share it with you. Instead, those frustrations can fester and damage your relationship in the long run. To gauge the effort level for your employees, put yourself in their shoes and think about: Note that some challenges are good, especially when new ideas are brought up. This ensures that you’re always letting the best idea win, regardless of who pitched it. However, if someone is sharing their feelings with you, such as feeling frustrated when you interrupt them, this isn’t a place to challenge them, but rather probe to fully understand their point of view. When it comes to your direct report’s sharing feelings, this is the difference between challenging and probing: You’ve reached a point where your direct report feels comfortable and safe enough to open up to you. How you act on that feedback is what will impact the benefit for their sharing. If they share a challenge they’re facing, it’s not enough to say you’ll do it, you actually   to do it. It can be as simple as letting them know you need the week to think about it and you’ll re-discuss during your next one-on-one. It can also be more complex like changing a process that they felt was broken or inefficient. When your direct report feels like opening up to you improved their situation, they’ll continue to open up. There are so many   at your fingertips that can help drive more meaningful conversations between you and your team. When it comes to your one-on-ones, try adding in a new prompt to your meeting agenda every meeting. Keep in mind that, if it’s a question that can be answered by both of you, be the first to answer. For example, if you ask your direct report, “What has been the work highlight/lowlight from the past week?” be prepared to answer that question, too. Being vulnerable with your team is a great way to continue to build trust with each individual. It also builds a supportive  , which will help propel the team forward.\xa0 '], 31: ['The path to becoming a freelancer is exciting, but there’s a long road ahead before you start accepting work. Ideally, you’ll want a bit of time to curate your professional brand before seeking temporary jobs within   or by networking on your own. There are multiple steps involved with marketing yourself as someone suitable for particular roles and projects, and it’s up to you to sell your skills strategically. So, what are those steps?\xa0 Before diving into the several steps involved with beginning  , it’s important to take some time for self-discovery and ask yourself a simple question: “Why?” Why do you want to become a freelancer? Some people prefer being their own boss, others value the time and flexibility freelancing provides. Whatever drives you to become a freelancer will drive you to follow the path to become a successful one. Once you’ve solidified the confidence in your chosen career direction, consider the type of work you plan on accepting. Freelancers typically belong in a single industry and deliver a specific type of work. For example, prospective freelance writers should decide whether they want to accept a variety of writing projects or focus on particular writing requests, such as blogs.\xa0 Additionally, prospective freelancers should consider how they plan on finding their first clients and what types of projects they want to initially work on. It’s always a good idea to get a variety of projects under your belt and get accustomed to the process before committing to freelancing as a permanent career. Before freelance platforms existed, freelancers relied solely on word of mouth job opportunities, self-marketing tactics and old-fashioned networking to get clients. Networking can simply involve contacting previous employers, marketing yourself on social media or attending networking events. If those options aren’t ideal, new freelancers can also use freelance platforms immediately. There is a lot involved with entering the vast marketplace of fellow freelancers within freelance platforms, and it’s worth getting to know whether the process is right for you. If you’ve decided to use a freelance platform, you’ll need to find one that fits your industry needs. There are many platforms that cater to all industries, but there are also niche platforms that focus on specific jobs as well. These decisions are all personal preference, so it may be worth bouncing around several platforms to decide which is the best option for you. After deciding on the perfect type of platform, your main goal is to stand out among the competition in the freelance platform’s marketplace. For example, if you’re a graphic designer, consider the many other graphic designers on the platform looking for the same type of gigs you’re looking for. Competition is healthy and can be motivating, but it can also be draining. It’s much easier to go up against the rest by following a few steps. By following these steps, you’ll be able to carve a path toward accepting your first clients with ease. The need for portfolios depends on your title. Graphic designers, writers and photographers all benefit from showcasing their creative abilities through a carefully selected set of work they’re proud of. A typical  , for example, is a way to showcase particularly impressive projects that will make you stand out to potential clients. An easy and accessible way to show off a digital portfolio is to use a  . Having a professional website is like having a simple self-marketing tool that can be easily shared on social media or your freelance platform profile. One of the greatest aspects of freelancing is the ability to set your own wage. Typically, freelancers set an hourly wage, but flat rates for projects are common as well. First, consider your living situation and ask yourself, “What is my ideal salary?” Whatever that might be, consider the cost of being your own boss. There are plenty of expenses associated with freelancing that may impact your overall take-home pay. Office supplies, a computer, Wi-Fi and other supplies and services can cost a lot of money and should be considered when figuring out what your wages should look like. In addition, you’ll need to plan out how many days you intend to work and factor in any potential days off in advance to get an accurate idea of your annual income. Once you’ve settled on your annual income, calculate your hourly rate. Here’s a handy formula to get you started: The next step when figuring out your wage is researching how much your competitors are charging, whether it’s in a freelance setting or a corporate setting. Your competition impacts your value and the ease of obtaining clients, so it’s up to you how competitive you want your wages to be. You’re finally ready to start searching for gigs! On a freelance platform, you have the opportunity to scope out the right job for you. While searching, read through each job post carefully and ensure the job fits your personal requirements. Some platforms have a daily or monthly application limit, so choose where to apply wisely. With all the necessary measures in place, you’re ready to move forward into the gig economy with confidence. It’s important to remember that being a freelancer also means being your own boss. Being your own boss involves most of the entrepreneurial up and downs you would expect, but the pros and cons are well worth it once you get the ball rolling and accept your first few clients. ', 'Freelancers aren’t the only ones thriving in the gig economy. Businesses are hiring more freelancers than ever, and it’s all thanks to the accessibility of   and the overall increase in the number of freelancers. According to the  , 48% of businesses hired freelancers in 2018, up from 43% in 2017. Additionally, 9 out of 10 hiring managers stated they were open to hiring freelancers over hiring temporary workers through a staffing firm. These statistics prove that companies are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits freelancers provide. As businesses progressively start to understand the benefits of hiring freelancers, they’ll start becoming interested in hiring them, but where does the hiring process start? How does a business hire a freelancer? We’ll cover all that and more. The first thing a business should consider before hiring a   is whether a freelancer is right for the role they aim to fill. It’s important to understand the distinction between a full-time employee and a freelancer, as both types of employees bring different skills and qualities to the table. A business that has a specific need or role in mind that isn’t suitable for a full-time position should turn to a freelancer.\xa0 After settling on the job that needs to be filled, businesses have a few options to move forward in the hiring process. A common tactic is using   to hire temporary workers. Staffing agencies essentially handle the hiring process for businesses and ensure the freelancers they connect businesses to are viable for the position in question. Businesses can venture out to networking events or leverage social media to find suitable candidates. In-person networking is especially helpful for getting to know a potential temporary employee, giving employers an opportunity to scope out different candidates in a short period of time. Social media is also an asset for hiring, as freelancers often market themselves on a variety of platforms. Businesses also benefit from utilizing freelance platforms, which are essentially a marketplace employers can use to locate freelancers looking for work. Freelance websites connect freelancers and employees on one platform, making it easy for businesses to handle the freelance hiring process on their own. Getting started on a freelance platform is fairly simple from a company standpoint. The first step is to create a job posting. Similar to  , freelance platforms allow companies to advertise an available position they’d like filled. In turn, the job posting is shared to the marketplace of freelancers available on the platform. A job posting is a great opportunity for businesses to describe what they’re looking for in a candidate, such as ideal skill sets and experience. On top of the responses received from a job posting, businesses can also be alerted when specific freelancers are available in the marketplace that fit their needs. These alerts can be sent straight to a hiring manager’s inbox as a shortlist to ease the hiring process even further. Once a candidate is found, the business can easily initiate a chat to get the hiring process started. Freelance platforms provide additional benefits, too. One perk is the screening process. These platforms screen freelance applicants to ensure their experience and background fit the needs of the business. Screening measures typically authenticate whether the freelancer is fit to work on their projects of interest using assessments similar to  . The measures also include any feedback or job scores the freelancer has involving their previous work. These insights help ensure their work is consistently up to par. However, it’s the responsibility of the employer to perform a more comprehensive screening process if necessary, such as background or drug tests. Freelance platforms also handle the payment process. Depending on the tool, the payroll can be handled on a project-by-project basis automatically, or the business can choose to pay its freelancers on a monthly basis for as long as the freelancer is on board. There are many advantages associated with hiring freelancers. Freelancers, especially those who work remotely, cost businesses much less money than a typical full-time employee who works in a physical office. Freelancers are responsible for handling their own operational costs, such as office supplies, computers and Wi-Fi. In addition, employers don’t have to fully onboard a new freelancer and do not have to pay for the typical benefits they provide to full-time employees, such as health insurance and paid time off. Since freelancers focus on temporary work, they often have a variety of work experience under their belt. Freelancers are more likely to have exposure to vastly different project scenarios and common industry issues since they take on so many roles. When hiring a freelancer for a specific project, businesses can focus on freelancers who have experience and skills closely related to the project, making them highly specialized experts for the individual task. (For example, a company that requires a logo would benefit from hiring a freelancer that has experience in making logos and highlights their expertise in logos, specifically, rather than hiring a full-time graphic designer that is a jack-of-all-trades in design. Businesses looking to hire freelancers have the option to search globally. This vastly increases the pool of potential applicants and makes it more likely that the business will quickly locate an expert to fit its needs. Freelancers are great assets for businesses spanning across all industries, and hiring one isn’t as hard as it might seem. By taking advantage of all the methods of locating the right freelancer, your business can have all the niche roles filled in a short amount of time.\xa0 ', 'When you read the word “gig,” another word probably comes to mind: "temporary." This is the foundation on which the gig economy is based. While the concept of a “side hustle” is not new, the age of digital transformation has created a quick path to short-term jobs. This is colloquially referred to as the gig economy. Before we\xa0go\xa0into what the gig economy is, let’s start with the definition.\xa0 Freelancers attract consumers by providing goods or services. Examples of services providers include, but are not limited to, handymen, drivers and cleaning services. Workers that provide on-demand goods might be artists, photographers or writers. Freelancers are independent workers that perform temporary jobs or projects for consumers. Unsurprisingly, freelancers are the main component that keeps the gig economy moving. The other major component of the gig economy is the connection between freelancers, and consumers and businesses. Most commonly, the two groups are connected through  , which essentially act as a freelancer marketplace. They also facilitate transactions between freelancers and their clients. The gig economy has many benefits that drive its growing popularity. Job flexibility is the driving force that keeps the gig economy flourishing. Freelancers are free to establish their preferences and expectations before taking on a new job or project. They can also independently negotiate their wages. For anyone seeking to become their own boss, freelancing is an optimal route. Temporary work is also a great option for those that dislike a traditional routine. Freelancers can choose a variety of projects, so the work can vary greatly. Additionally, they can set their own hours, pay, and, occasionally, deadlines. This flexibility is key for people that have irregular schedules, multiple jobs, or simply enjoy making their own schedule. Not everything in the gig economy is positive. One of the major disadvantages is the lack of benefits. While more businesses are including comprehensive benefits packages for freelancers, there’s a long way to go before it becomes the norm. For freelancers that don’t have benefits, the   offers resources to help them independently set up insurance, a retirement account and more. Another disadvantage is the extra hassle involved with taxes, payroll and independent decision-making. A typical employee gets their taxes withdrawn from their paycheck, making tax season a bit less daunting than it is for entrepreneurs. Freelancers rely on income tracking and tax preparation apps to keep track of their taxes and the paperwork involved, which can be stressful. Furthermore, while the independence of freelancing is a perk, it is also a burden. Freelancers must stay up to date with the average pay bands in their field. If their requested pay rate is too high, they’re less likely to get hired. If their requested pay is too low, they’re missing out on deserved revenue. Businesses have a lot to gain from the gig economy. Freelancers are a great choice for companies with temporary or urgent projects. Freelancers let businesses hire a one-off employee with no long-term commitment as quickly as possible. Businesses with a global market also rely on freelancers. As long as the work can be done remotely, businesses can hire freelancers around the world, making round-the-clock work possible. For example, a global retailer based in the U.S. might want to hire customer service representatives in different time zones so customers can always get in touch. The ability to hire globally is a perk in itself. It expands the pool of job applicants with diverse skills. Hiring freelancers is also more cost-effective. Onboarding a new, full-time employee can be pricey. With freelancers, businesses don’t need to buy new equipment or spend money on benefits and other onboarding expenses. According to Forbes,   Americans are part of the gig economy. That’s more than one-third of the population. So, how are these workers finding their jobs? Many gig workers find jobs by traditional networking, connecting with old jobs or coworkers, and using social media. However, freelance platforms have been disrupting these methods. According to the  , 22% of full-time freelancers said they plan to use a freelance platform over the next 12 months. Additionally, millennials are three times more likely to use online platforms to find work than baby boomers. Freelance platforms are appealing, as they streamline the job-seeking process on a single platform. As freelancing becomes easier and more lucrative, the number of freelancers is expected to grow. With that in mind, the gig economy is still developing. It has a long way to go for it to become as stable as a typical 9-to-5 job. Freelancing is essentially being your own boss, which has plenty of advantages and setbacks to consider. For anyone looking to dip their toes into entrepreneurship, freelancing is a good start.

While there are some technologies and techniques that will help speed up answering security questionnaires in online portals, strategies for automation rely heavily on proprietary third-party integrations that can be costly and may only apply to one “flavor” of security. As a vendor who will be facing more security questionnaires of increasing sophistication, you have a challenge to answer them efficiently and comprehensively.\xa0 A security questionnaire is used when an organization needs to assess whether their data will be safe when it’s beyond their control, typically in the hands of a vendor. Consumers and clients trust organizations with their business and private data with the assumption that it will be safe while under that organization’s control. Organizations must ensure that any person or entity outside of the organization maintains a minimum level of security equal to that of the organization.\xa0 In other words, if you have a bodyguard with a black belt in karate who goes with you everywhere to make sure your wallet is safe, you cannot let anyone borrow your wallet unless their bodyguard also has at least a black belt in karate. And both bodyguards need to be there when you hand over your wallet, even though the place where the handoff takes place is supposed to be completely secure, too. Security questionnaires generally come from one of the following three places: One thing a security questionnaire is not is a  . There are two major differences. One, DDQs are not as detailed and focus more on process. You may receive a DDQ when an organization wants to know how you will comply with their standards and meet their needs. It’s in the security questionnaire where you’ll have to provide the proof. Two, DDQs usually arrive earlier in the sales process compared to a security questionnaire. Think of the DDQ as the first filter. Organizations figure that if you don’t know how to comply at the DDQ stage, then it’s not worth spending time on the details further along in the sales process.\xa0 That doesn’t necessarily mean that security questionnaires should be viewed as key milestones in the sales process. They can appear early on like DDQs, but they can also appear at the demo stage further along in the sales process or even post close when onboarding plans begin to take shape. Receiving a security questionnaire is not an indication of your eventual success.\xa0 But not responding on time and accurately could certainly kill a deal.\xa0 In the olden days, software applications were hosted in house, or on premise, which meant that the owner of the data was in possession of it at all times. There were still security questionnaires, but they were much less involved. With the SaaS shift, data and business critical applications are trusted to a third party. Before an organization onboards a SaaS solution, it has to be confident in two things, from a security perspective. One, all of its data will be safe with the vendor of that SaaS solution. Two, the application will be available when it’s needed and compliant with agreed-upon uptime benchmarks (e.g. you don’t want the HR system going down just before processing payroll). Security questionnaires have proliferated as a result of the onslaught of SaaS solutions.\xa0 Nevertheless, security questionnaires assess more than just aspects specific to data security, such as encryption or storage. Questions may cover network security, auditing and compliance processes, and even the physical security of your locations just to name a few. The fact is that questionnaires are becoming more common, longer, and more complex for two primary reasons. First, SaaS solutions are growing in complexity and interconnectivity. Rarely is there a business application that is entirely standalone. They often need to talk to each other to help organizations achieve a larger goal. The more applications that need to talk to each other, the greater the greater risk exposure, which results in more stringent security assessments. Second, threats are constantly evolving. There’s no such thing as a 100% secure system, primarily because no matter how secure and intelligent systems get, there will always be a human fingerprint somewhere.\xa0 From voting systems to fuel distribution networks to large retailers, bad actors can pivot quickly to direct cyber attacks wherever they find a weakness.\xa0\xa0 An honest, direct, and complete response. And to respect their time. Pay attention to the instructions. Some questions require brief, direct answers. Others require detailed explanations about the types of controls in place. Even with automation support, you’ll have to think through every response to make sure it’s properly answered. If a two-part response is required, always provide a brief description of your answer. This is especially important when you have to answer “no” or “not applicable”. Your response doesn’t always have to be in the affirmative. Don’t say yes because you have plans to implement something. Those plans become obligations that you may not be able to fulfill. Never answer in the affirmative if you cannot deliver. Always expect the client to ask for proof.\xa0\xa0 Be direct. Use an active voice. Concision matters. Sometimes questions are asked in different ways multiple times. Avoid copy and pasting and possibly sounding evasive. Don’t waste time trying to guess reviewers’ priorities. They rarely reveal what’s mandatory. Assume compliance and risk teams will be reviewing all responses with a fine-toothed comb.\xa0 Your goal should be to have as complete a response as possible. The more complete the response, the less likely you are to have follow-ups – the sooner the risk assessment is complete, the sooner the deal can close. You don’t want the security questionnaire response to hold up the deal. They come later in the sales process and multiple rounds of follow-ups or clarifications will slow down the process, which will frustrate your sales team to no end. In most cases, security questionnaires assess a wide spectrum of security controls. Expect questions across multiple types of security.\xa0 Many questions and content requirements will fall under one of the following four components. Proof of security compliance certifications is the most commonly requested piece of information in a security questionnaire. Examples of security compliance certificates include Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and National Institute of Standards and Framework's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). These will likely be your most time consuming. They cover a lot of areas, including information, physical, application, infrastructure, and network security. These questions assess your IT security, data privacy, and business resiliency policies. Sometimes you’ll be asked to provide the full policy document. Other times you’ll be asked to pull out specific sections. This component is where organizations want to assess your procedures to safeguard customer information, data, and systems.\xa0 Questions and requests may focus on: If an organization is going to accept your risk by adding you as a vendor, then they need to know what they’re getting into. Even more important, they want to know what you’re already doing to mitigate risk.\xa0 You’ll see inquiries such as: Note that you probably already have many of the answers to these questions. The question is where are they located? That’s the key to answering security questionnaires faster. With more security questionnaires coming as a result of the proliferation of SaaS (and infrastructure as a service [IaaS] and platform as a service [PaaS]), accuracy, efficiency, and repeatability will be essential to seamlessly responding to multiple questionnaires every year. These five tips will help. Automation solutions already exist. Ironically, they’re SaaS, too. What’s important, whether you build your own or seek out a vendor, is that the solution has AI/ML capabilities to do more than just copy and paste. There’s more to a response than finding any answer; you have to be able to find the best answer, fast.\xa0 You likely already have most of the answers to security questionnaires. Usually, the problem is that the documents where these answers lie are siloed, duplicated, outdated, may only allow limited access, and are not searchable. Centralizing your content will solve this problem. Your internal and external collaboration mechanisms will drive improvement here. In addition to AI/ML-enabled automation, cueing up assignments for subject matter experts to answer and review can also be automated. Getting your team in lockstep is essential to avoiding those frustrating follow-up questions that can result from an incomplete or inaccurate response. AI/ML automation works best on downloadable forms, such as spreadsheets, documents, or PDFs. Online portals are more troublesome and, as of this writing, can only be automated through backend partnerships between security questionnaire issuer and responder solution providers. One technology that can help is a browser extension portal that links to your content library. They help you work through an online portal faster because you don’t have to switch between applications to access answers. This portrays proficiency and good will. It also gives your client greater peace of mind that you take security seriously while respecting their valuable time. Answering security questionnaires in one form or another will be part of the vendor onboarding process for the foreseeable future.  , you can expect security questionnaires to continue to grow in size and sophistication. Cybersecurity spending is slated to exceed $1 trillion, and third-party vendors account for 63% of data breaches. Organizations will want more assurances that their data will be safe and that their applications will be available.\xa0 By implementing business processes that take a security questionnaire from intake to submission, automating as much of the response process as possible, and improving collaboration to keep subject matter experts on task, you can speed up and simplify how you answer questionnaires. Your goal is to never let security questionnaires be a bottleneck to the sales process.\xa0 ", 'Building a tech stack is one of the most difficult tasks that IT admins, cybersecurity professionals, and business owners face.\xa0 This is because building a set of productivity and cybersecurity tools requires a careful set of balancing acts.\xa0 In principle, the more   tools you deploy, the more secure your systems will be, but only up until a particular point: if you make your stack too complex it can become difficult to manage, and thereby introduce vulnerabilities, as well as increasing your up-front investment in technical systems.\xa0 A report by Aberdeen and Cyber adAPT found that a typical six-layer enterprise tech stack – comprised of networking, storage, physical servers, as well as virtualization, management, and application layers – requires CISOs to grapple with   of tech installations for 336 products, provided by 57 vendors. This problem is exacerbated by the increasingly dynamic nature of most corporate environments. The rise in  , the renewed interest in managing virtual teams, and the   over the past ten years is an indication that many companies are now looking to develop cybersecurity stacks that can be effectively deployed off-site, with the added complexities that this brings. In this article, we\'ll go back to basics. Building an effective cybersecurity tool stack rests, at a fundamental level, on a number of key principles. Have these in mind as you build and develop your own stack, and you\'ll be able to reach the balance of simplicity and functionality that is the mark of a great tool stack. The first and most important step in building a cybersecurity tool stack is to have in place a cybersecurity and information governance strategy. That might sound obvious, but it is a step that many organizations still overlook:   in PwC’s 2018 Global State of Information Security Survey said that they didn\'t have an overall information security strategy in place.\xa0 Without a thorough and rigorous cybersecurity strategy, it is almost impossible to build a tool stack that genuinely mitigates the threats you face. Any tool stack developed without strategic oversight will likely suffer from a number of interlinked issues. It will either be inadequately broad to deal with the breadth of your threat profile, quickly become obsolete given the growing number of threats out there, or will not allow you sufficient oversight of your data to meet governance and compliance legislation. Two examples of this may be given. The precipitous   in the last few years has taken many companies by surprise, because they are used to protecting data rather than their computing resources, and without regular threat audits many have found it hard to respond. Similarly, the rising   over the past decade has made many legacy remote working solutions almost useless, because companies have taken it for granted that off-site workers have complete access to all of the online resources and systems they need. It\'s not all bad news, however. Developing a cybersecurity framework is not just about mitigating risk: it can also improve productivity. In Tenable’s 2016 survey,   with a framework in place have seen benefits, including greater effectiveness of security operations, contractual compliance, maturity, and the ability to more effectively present security readiness to business leadership. Once you have an effective risk management framework in place, it\'s time to honestly assess   that your business faces, and prioritize those risks that will have the largest impact on the sustainability of your business.\xa0 Most cybersecurity analysis firms will break the kinds of threats faced by the average business into  : These five elements are also those contained in what remains the most thorough framework for planning cybersecurity strategy:  . This framework includes five principles (identify, detect, protect, respond, and recover from threats) that mirror those above, and present a start-to-finish approach for dealing with cyberthreats.\xa0 With a cybersecurity strategy in place, you can begin to invest in the tools required to protect your data (and your staff) from cyberthreats. The value of conceiving of your systems as a series of elements, and of following the NIST framework alongside this, is that this approach highlights that your network is not a monolithic whole. Each level of your system should be defended, and each of these defensive tools should build on the last.\xa0 There are two major lessons to be drawn from the kind of analysis we\'ve explained above. One is that companies should balance their cybersecurity spend across all five elements in their network security,\xa0 because ultimately the security of your systems is only as good as that of the weakest part. The second is that it points to a defensive paradigm that was first popularized by the NSA, but is now a fundamental part of most businesses\' cybersecurity strategy: "defense in depth". Let\'s take these two ideas in turn. The primary value of risk assessment according to the rubric above is that it allows companies to balance their investment in cybersecurity stack tools according to the type of data they hold, and where their vulnerabilities are most acute. For businesses who need to protect significant amounts of intellectual property, for instance,   are likely to be a major priority, and the area in which more advanced cybersecurity tools will need to be deployed. This kind of company should also focus on breach protection, and intrusion mitigation, because they hold valuable (and therefore potentially vulnerable) data. Another type of company, say one that is focused on  , will need to prioritize a different part of their stack. A company which delivers most of its services via the web will need to focus more on DDoS protection and server integrity. Instead of value being held in data, in this kind of company sustainability is represented by uptime, and this should inform purchasing decisions when it comes to building a cybersecurity tool stack. The concept of "defense in depth" is one that is inherently contained within the idea of a cybersecurity "stack". In practice, this means that your defenses should be organized as a series of defensive layers, each building on the last. It also means that the methods used by these defensive mechanisms should be well diversified.\xa0 The central idea here is that hackers should be presented with a series of escalating defenses and countermeasures. As well as thinking of your stack as protecting you at the five levels we\'ve covered above, this also means that your tools should make use of as many of the following techniques as possible: Defense in depth also means that companies should not see their defenses as an impenetrable “wall” that will deter all intruders. Instead, you should accept that, eventually, some of your first-line defenses will be breached. A good example of this is email security. The vast majority of firms will use email provided by either Microsoft or Google. Both these systems come with well-known security vulnerabilities, and it is also well-known that the vast majority of cyberattacks start with a   email. Trying to stop all of these attacks at the level of employee inboxes is essentially impossible whilst still providing the flexibility and functionality that employees require to work productively. Instead, companies should look to the next level of security: where emails are stored, which for most firms will be cloud storage. Therefore, email encryption and staff training are critical in preventing cyberattacks, ensuring defense in depth also means putting in place encrypted cloud storage solutions for email, and backing up these encrypted archives.\xa0 When working through the framework above, you will immediately recognize that building a secure cybersecurity stack will likely involve investing in multiple tools from multiple vendors. This diversity – as we\'ve pointed out – is critical for ensuring strong cybersecurity defenses, but it can also cause issues.\xa0 This is because there is a tendency for companies to sub-contract security services for the various levels of their cybersecurity stacks without carefully thinking through the responsibilities that each vendor should be given. Alongside investing in quality tools, therefore, your cybersecurity strategy should also involve a careful mapping of which of your vendors are taking responsibility for which parts of your system: both on an operational basis, and when it comes to possible litigation following a cyberattack. Ideally, your relationship with your vendors should be thought of as a business partnership, rather than as a simple buyer-supplier relationship. Quality vendors can be recognized by the time and effort they take to understand your needs, and their responsiveness to them. A respectable vendor will also be able to outline their precise operational and legal responsibilities when it comes to protecting your data.\xa0 When it comes to building cybersecurity stacks, many businesses still exhibit "target fixation". Depending on the sector they work within, it can be tempting to focus solely on one part of your cybersecurity infrastructure: protecting data if your business model is based on analytics and data acquisition, for instance, or attempting to make your outreach platforms 100% secure if you work in marketing. As we\'ve shown above, this kind of approach is problematic because it fails to realize the central insight of the "stack" model. Instead of building supposedly impenetrable walls around your network, you need to accept that eventually someone will intrude into it. At that point, they should be faced with an escalating series of difficulties. By taking a more holistic approach, you can improve security at every level of your stack – whether you are working with marketing data or   – and ensure that there is no chink in your armor.\xa0 ', 'Firewalls are the OG cybersecurity tools, dating back nearly three decades.

AR blends physical and digital worlds to create an experience within the tiny space of a few-inch widescreen. That makes it a thing of fascination for businesses all around the world who are vying to win customer attention. Augmented reality works like a tech that is straight out of the  It is a technology that can project digital media superimposed on real-world surfaces without demanding any heavy hardware or software requirements. Although we don’t much about how the technologies in   work, AR is powered by three major technologies. They are responsible for collecting real-world images, processing them and overlaying them digital media — be it text or imagery. There are three major technologies that make augmented reality work. In fact, these are the technologies that makes it possible to superimpose digital media on physical spaces in the right dimensions and at the right location. They do not work as standalone technologies, instead they interact with each other by supplying data to one another to make AR function.\xa0  renders virtual images over real-world spaces/objects. It works with the help of localizing sensors (like gyroscope or accelerometer) that map the entire physical space or object. A complex AR simulation is conducted by its algorithm which renders the virtual image in the right dimensions on the space or object. Most of the augmented reality APIs and SDKs available today come with built-in SLAM capabilities.  is used to measure the distance of the object or surface from the AR device’s camera sensor. It works the same a camera would work to focus on the desired object and blur out the rest of its surroundings. Once SLAM and depth tracking is completed, the AR program will process the image as per requirements and projects it on the user's screen. The user screen could be a dedicated device (like Microsoft Hololens) or any other device with the AR application. The image is collected from the user’s device lens and processed in the backend by the AR application. SLAM and depth tracking makes it possible to render the image in the right dimensions and at the right location. Let’s take a restaurant locator app as an example. When the user points their device at the restaurant, the AR app would fetch the location details, match it additional details like star rating, reviews, directions, seat availability, and more. and finally place such information on the screen. SLAM and depth tracking makes it possible to pace the digital information as viewed through the screen on the physical object in the right dimension. Apart from the three technologies — SLAM, depth tracking and image processing, there are also a handful of other subset technologies that make AR work.\xa0Primary among them are two types of technologies that detect objects: trigger-based and view-based. Both trigger-based and view-based augmentations have several subsets.\xa0 There are triggers that activate the augmentation by detecting AR markers, symbols, icons, GPS locations, and so on. When the AR device is pointed at the AR marker, the AR app processes the 3D image and projects it on the user device.\xa0 Marker-based augmentation works by scanning and recognizing AR markers. AR markers are paper-printer markers in the form of specific designs. They look more or less like bar codes and enable the AR app to create digitally enhanced 360-degree images on the AR device. Nike’s SNKRs app is an example of marker-based augmentation. Users can scan the marker which was designed in the form of a special Nike logo for the campaign to view premium sneakers on sale. It was created with markers distributed in newspapers, graffiti walls, posters and so on. The app helped Nike combat the menace of  . In this method of augmentation, the AR app picks up the real-time location of the device and combines it with dynamic information fetched from cloud servers or from the app’s backend. Most maps and navigation that have AR facilities, or vehicle parking assistants work based on location-based augmentation. BMW’s heads-up display is a perfect example of location-based augmentation at work. Dynamic augmentation is the most responsive form of augmented reality. It leverages motion tracking sensors in the AR device to detect images from the real-world and super-imposes them with digital media. Sephora’s AR mirror is a perfect example of dynamic augmentation at work. The app works like a real-world mirror reflecting the user’s face on the screen. Using on-screen markers/pickers, the user can try on various Sephora products to see how they would look in real life. This helps Sephora reduce the amount of makeup that is lost on trials. It also saves time and effort for users on applying and removing makeup.\xa0 They are dynamic surfaces (like buildings, desktop surfaces, natural surroundings, etc.) which are detected by the AR app. The app connects the dynamic view to its backend to match reference points and projects related information on the screen. Let’s take a deep dive into how each of these works.\xa0 Superimposition-based augmentation works by detecting static objects that are already fed into the AR application’s database. The app uses optical sensors to detect the object and relays digital information above them. For example, Hyundai has an   which allows users to point their AR device at the engine. The AR will display each component name and how to perform basic maintenance process for each of those components. All this without having to refer to a hundred pages long owner’s manual Generic digital augmentation is what gives developers and artists the liberty to create anything that they wish the immersive experience of AR. It allows rendering of 3D objects that can be imposed on actual spaces. IKEA’s furniture shopping is a perfect example of generic digital augmentation.\xa0 Augmented reality is one-of-a-kind of immersive technology. Its ability to render digital information atop physical objects and surfaces has positioned it as a futuristic technology. It holds great  , education, engineering, marketing, customer service and several other sectors where information overload is becoming a problem. ", 'It might seem like virtual reality (VR) technology has only been around for a few short years. However, the VR systems and headsets we know today have been . The earliest progenitor of today\'s VR systems actually dates back to 1957 with  for a head-mounted stereoscopic television device. In the years since, VR technology has been making slow but steady progress. At first, developers lacked the computing power to make a true, immersive VR experience. Then, once they had it, the race was on to make it portable and affordable for the average consumer. That\'s where we are today. Companies like HTC, Oculus, Valve, and Sony now offer commercially viable VR hardware that\'s continuing to improve by leaps and bounds. For that reason, people all around the world are now familiar with VR and . Most don\'t, however, have a firm grasp on the specifics of the technology. To remedy that, here\'s a basic technical guide to virtual reality technology. You\'ll learn how it works, what it takes to make it work, and where the technology might go next. Let\'s dive in. At its core, VR technology has only one purpose: to simulate settings and environments realistically enough to fool the human brain into accepting them as reality. From a scientific standpoint, that all begins by understanding how our brains interpret the things we see to develop a mental picture of the world around us. Without getting into too much detail, the simplest explanation is that our perception of reality is based on rules we develop using our experiences as a guide. For example, when we see the sky, it tells us which direction is "up". When we see objects we can identify, we can use their size relative to one another to judge distance. We can also detect light sources by picking up on the shadows cast by the objects around us. VR designers can use those conventional rules to create virtual environments that conform to our mental expectations of reality. When they do, the result is a seamless experience that we interpret as "real". Today\'s commercial VR systems are all competing to determine which can provide the best possible user experience in a virtual setting. In truth, none of them are capable of a completely  , for one very simple reason: the technology hasn\'t caught up with the capabilities of human vision – yet. Here\'s a breakdown of where today\'s VR headsets are, and where they\'re trying to reach. From a technical point of view, one of the biggest hurdles is the fact that humans are capable of a much wider field of view (FOV) than today\'s headsets can provide. An average human can see the environment around them in a roughly  around their head. Where the eyesight from our left and right eyes overlap there is a roughly 114-degree arc, where we can see in 3D. Today\'s headsets focus their attention on that 114-degree 3D space to deliver their virtual environments. No headset, though, can yet accommodate the full FOV of the average human. Right now, though, today\'s VR hardware designers are aiming to create devices that will allow for a 180-degree FOV, which is considered ideal for a high-performance VR simulation. In the world of VR, there is perhaps no greater topic of disagreement than over how to deal with the frame rates of virtual environments. That\'s because there\'s no real scientific consensus on how sensitive human vision is in that regard. From a physical standpoint, we know that human eyes can see up to the equivalent of 1000 frames per second (FPS). The human brain, however, never receives such detail via the optic nerve. There have been studies that have suggested that humans can discern frame rates up to 150 FPS, but beyond that, the information is lost in translation on the way to the brain. For a movie you see in a theater, the frame rate is 24 FPS. That, however, isn\'t designed to simulate reality. For VR applications, most developers have found that anything less than 60 FPS tends to cause  in the user. For that reason, most developers aim for a VR content "sweet spot" of about 90 FPS and some ( ) won\'t certify software to run on their devices if they fall below 60 FPS at any point while in use. Going forward, though, most VR hardware developers are going to start pushing for a frame rate of 120 FPS or more, as that will provide a more true-to-life experience for most applications. Another crucial technical aspect of VR is the way that designers use sound effects to convey a sense of three-dimensional space to the user. Today, cutting-edge VR relies on a technology called  to create a simulated audio landscape that matches the visuals created by VR. Anyone who has ever sat in a well-designed concert hall should be familiar with how the sounds we hear can vary based on where we\'re located within a space and even which way we turn our heads. Spatial audio is a technique whereby VR designers can produce binaural (stereo) audio through a set of headphones that mimics that exact sensation. There are a , but they all share some similar characteristics, including:\xa0 It\'s also important to remember that for a VR headset, the audio effects described here must be computed in real-time to account for the movement of the user. When it comes to this, today\'s VR hardware is still just beginning to scratch the surface of what\'s possible. The real magic of VR doesn\'t come from how convincing the visuals or sound are (although those are critical foundational elements), it comes from the fact that users can move within a virtual space that adjusts to their position. It\'s what separates a VR headset from a simple set of . Right now, there are two types of head and position tracking in use for VR applications – measured in degrees of freedom - 3DoF and 6DoF. Mobile VR headsets like the , Google\'s , and the  use 3DoF, which means they are capable of rotational tracking only. They know when you turn your head left and right, look up or down, or tilt your head to one side or another. If you move your whole body, though, they won\'t pick that up. Headsets that use 6DoF, by contrast, can track the wearer\'s position within the room, as well as the direction their head is pointed. That means 6DoF headsets can allow for full autonomous movement through a 3D space, which is a far more convincing VR experience. The way it\'s done varies from platform to platform, but major methods tend to include camera-based tracking in concert with infrared light beacons. As advanced as today\'s VR technology is, it\'s bound to get a whole lot better in the coming years. As developments continue, we should start to see hardware with an enhanced, more lifelike FOV, and better 3D audio to match. That alone makes the near-term future of VR exciting. We\'re also on the cusp of seeing new improvements to VR that are going to make the experience vastly better than what you can get from today\'s hardware. One of those is the use of haptic feedback devices like the , which provide realistic touch sensations for the objects users interact with in VR. Another is a graphics technique known as , which takes advantage of the human eye\'s limited focal point to deliver ultra-high definition images only where our eyes are focused, thus lowering the computing power required to create the image. What\'s more important, though, are the new ways that VR is likely to be used. Parallel advances in  are going to make immersive distance learning a reality for the first time. Surgeons will benefit from  to improve patient outcomes. Those in need of treatment for PTSD and related disorders will . The bottom line here is that VR technology is only just beginning to realize its potential in a variety of fields. As the technology grows, so too will the applications that talented software developers, researchers, and business leaders dream up for it. From that standpoint, it\'s fair to say that we are much closer to the beginnings of the story of virtual reality than we are to the conclusion – and there\'s going to be a whole lot more amazing developments to come.\xa0 ', 'Escape into your own world with virtual reality technology. The idea of interacting with a digital world isn’t new, as movies like Tron (1982) and Spy Kids 3-D (2003) have brought conceptual technology to life on the big screen. But in today’s world, those same consumers can now interact with their own digital space. From gaming and social networking to education and marketing, there are many applications for this type of emerging tech. You’ve probably already participated in a virtual reality experience and didn’t even know it.\xa0 Unlike  , virtual reality is a fully digital experience that can either simulate or differ completely from the real world. The term virtual reality refers to a computer-generated, three-dimensional environment. In order to experience and interact with  , you’ll need the proper equipment, like a pair of VR glasses or a headset. Everything that makes up our perception of reality is due to our senses. So, in theory, everyone’s reality is unique to them. Taking that a step further, it would make sense that if you provided your sense with other simulated or computer-generated information, your perception of reality would change – creating a new, virtual one. Because VR tech creates a completely 3-D environment, you can imagine the amount of software involved. VR software works together with VR hardware to immerse the user into the virtual world. Developers also have to create interactive components within the environments that look and even feel like the real deal.\xa0\xa0  can be used to build experiences for consumers to virtually test products, learn something new, or build something themselves. Believe it or not, there are even VR social platforms! Learn more about the types of software required to create these types of user experiences, like VR content management systems, SDKs, and more. VR hardware is used in conjunction with the software to provide the illusion of being in a 3-D environment.\xa0 Common hardware includes VR glasses, gloves, and other accessories to simulate other senses like touch. There are three main types of virtual reality used today to transform the world around us, including non-immersive, semi-immersive, and fully-immersive simulations.\xa0 To get a better understanding of how the technology is used, let’s break down the different types of VR and see examples of each. Chances are when you think of VR, you’re picturing a fully-immersive experience – complete with head-mounted displays, headphones, gloves, and maybe a treadmill or some kind of suspension apparatus.\xa0 This type of VR is commonly used for gaming and other entertainment purposes in VR arcades or even in your home (empty, non-fragile room advised.)\xa0 Fully-immersive simulations give users the most realistic experience possible, complete with sight and sound. The VR headsets provide high-resolution content with a wide field of view. Whether you’re flying or fighting the bad guys, you’ll feel like you’re really there. Semi-immersive experiences provide users with a partially virtual environment to interact with. This type of   and training purposes and the experience is made possible with graphical computing and large projector systems. In this example, the instruments in front of the pilot are real and the windows are screens displaying virtual content.\xa0 It’s important to keep in mind that semi-immersive VR simulations still give users the perception of being in a different reality. This type of virtual reality is not always possible to experience  . Instead, physical environments are created to supplement the virtual reality.\xa0 Non-immersive simulations are often forgotten as an actual type of VR, honestly because it’s very common in our everyday lives. The average video game is technically considered a non-immersive virtual reality experience. Think about it, you’re sitting in a physical space, interacting with a virtual one.\xa0 These types of experiences have become\xa0 more advanced in recent years with video games like Wii Sports, where the system actually detects your motion and translates it on screen.\xa0 People consume more content across more mediums today than ever before. As brands begin to leverage emerging technology like virtual reality, these experiences will start to take hold in our daily lives. '], 35: ["To learn the differences between the two server types, it's important to understand each on its own. Ad servers are a common form of web server used specifically for publishing advertisements. Companies can generate revenue from their content and utilize campaign management tools to facilitate   projects. Application servers are much different and are typically used by developers and IT administrators rather than marketing teams. 15 3.0/5 ", "Programmatic is becoming a dominant form of media buying in digital advertising. In fact, for digital  , more than   in the US in 2020 will be purchased using programmatic. Advertisers increasingly prefer to purchase ad spaces automatically through real-time auctions in the programmatic ecosystem. This method is more cost-effective than direct and provides extensive options for targeting. Publishers are quickly adopting programmatic to streamline sales of the inventory. The key to succeeding in this new programmatic landscape is to understand the publishers' side in programmatic media buying and how SSP helps them monetize their inventory effectively. A supply-side platform is a software for publishers to monetize traffic from their media. SSP is a gateway for publishers to trade their advertising inventory programmatically across their website, game, or mobile app through an automated auction. The SSP enables them to fill their ad spaces with ads and receive revenue. The main objective of the SSP is to provide timely reporting on campaign results and maximize the price of ad spaces for publishers. A supply-side platform is a critical component of the programmatic ecosystem that allows publishers to auction off the impressions of their audience. The SSP links publishers to multiple buyers and puts forward inventory for bidding. SSP provides an interface for publishers to oversee ad campaigns. It can review campaign details, manage the format of ad inventory, and control CPM (i.e. cost per thousand impressions). SSP provides a single platform that can work with several campaigns and trade with multiple demand partners. An SSP can integrate with DSPs, agency trading desks, ad networks, and ad exchanges. SSP represents publishers in the programmatic ecosystem and negotiates the deals on their behalf. After the publisher sets up SSP ad tags on their pages, the media buying takes place automatically through a real-time auction or other programmatic buying methods.\xa0SSP streamlines the process and automatically reviews the ad request, combines it with the relevant inventory, and conducts an instant negotiation. Although inventory trading is fully automated, publishers have several mechanisms to avoid bad deals. SSP safeguards the publisher's revenue with a minimum price for impression. Publishers can set up the   for the inventory, and the auction will never fall below it. Additionally, SSP guards the reputation and brand safety of its partners. SSPs have an effective mechanism to filter out spam and inappropriate ads and help publishers to build a loyal audience. Publishers can restrict the ads that are shown on their pages, with whitelists and blacklists of advertisers. For instance, a publisher can prevent tobacco and alcohol companies from displaying ads on websites with content geared toward children.\xa0 SSP has several methods of selling ad inventory programmatically. Through an SSP, a publisher can establish a priority and sell some of the inventory directly, reserve some for the closed marketplace of selected advertisers, and auction off the rest through real-time bidding. This method resembles direct media buys between the publisher and advertiser. The parties agree on the number of impressions and the price. Those impressions are reserved and guaranteed to a particular advertiser, and not offered anywhere else. The negotiations occur automatically through an API. A preferred deal is a method of setting up primary advertising partners. The publishers first offer their inventory to the selected advertisers at a pre-negotiated price. However, a particular number of impressions are not guaranteed. If advertisers skip the chance to purchase those impressions, they are then transferred further to a private marketplace (PMP). Preferred deals provide a great convenience for publishers to sell inventory directly to high-paying clients, with a possibility to sell it via other methods if the inventory remains unused. A private marketplace or PMP is an invitation-only trading platform for selected advertisers. Frequently, it is used by big publishers and media holdings with premium segments in their inventory. Instead of parading their inventory on the market, they sell it to a close circle of advertisers, such as luxury brands. The process of buying and selling ad space takes place through a closed real-time auction with an exclusive number of participants. In the private marketplace, the advertiser's DSP connects directly to the SSP.  is the broad term that sometimes includes   and  , and may encompass various selling methods. At the core, real-time bidding or RTB is a way of trading advertising spaces in the form of individual impressions through the real-time auction. The process of selling and buying takes place in the browser, server, or ad exchange that connects to publishers through an SSP and to advertisers through a DSP. The transactions occur instantly within milliseconds while the web page is loading. Real-time bidding is usually an open marketplace without particular restrictions, where everybody can join. Nevertheless, three distinct models define the dynamic of sales:  OpenRTB uses the method of waterfalling or daisy-chaining, sequentially selling the publishers' inventory, requesting one demand source at a time. Publishers run a succession of real-time auctions until all of their ad inventory is bought. Publishers offer the inventory sequentially to the demand partners in the established order, according to their historical yield. OpenRTB operates via the second-price auction model. The winning bidder pays the price offered by the second-highest bidder plus $0.01.\xa0 Header bidding is another auction model that is starting to get mainstream adoption in the industry. In header bidding instead of the separate auction for each demand partner, ad exchanges can bid at the same time at the highest priority in the ad server. Header-bidding uses the plain and simple first-price auction model. Not all of the SSPs offer the header-bidding functionality. Header bidding is becoming a new standard in the industry, while openRTB remains a practical strategy for publishers who want to prioritize a specific pool of advertisers.\xa0 There is also a   that combines features of header-bidding and openRTB to deliver the maximum value of each impression. The server conducts the openRTB second-price auction and then goes on to a header bidding first-price auction.\xa0The winning bids compete in an additional auction that determines the best price offer. The hybrid model increases the chances of getting higher bids and amplifies monetization. SSP services are a crowded marketplace of companies hustling to stand out and prove their value. According to the Programmatic Intelligence Report, on average, publishers use   to diversify traffic and to get access to various features. Publishers want to work with SSPs that partner with numerous demand partners and can help them make better decisions by sharing insights and timely reporting results of the campaign. Let's go over the six key features that publishers look for when choosing SSPs.\xa0 SSPs support various advertising formats. When you contract an SSP, you can be confident that their publishers adhere to a single ad serving protocol, and consequently, you won't need additional adjustment to serve ad creatives. SSPs work in a range of different media environments: web, in-app, in-game, CTV, DOOH. In each environment, SSP supports various ad formats: display ads, banner ads, native ads, playable, push, and video ads. Some SSPs specialize in web advertising, mobile and desktop traffic, and there are certain SSPs that operate exclusively in the OTT/CTV sector. However, most SSPs are trying to grasp more niche markets and reach as many environments and formats as possible. SSPs are optimized in real time based on the extensive publisher's data. It allows marketers and advertisers to aim at individual impressions instead of buying blocks of advertising. The actioning model fosters the transparency of the digital marketplace and allows advertisers to get real market-value of the ad placements. Auctioning may drive up the price of specific placements, but in the long run, it is a  than direct media buys SSPs provide information-rich geolocation data for the advertisers. The precision depends on the type of device and its connection to the network. Desktop devices with fixed internet access can provide IP information for  , although it is rarely accurate beyond the country level. Geotargeting for mobile devices is distinct from targeting desktop impressions. Mobile devices can connect to the web in several different ways: SSPs structure data from publishers to offer better targeting options for advertisers. Publishers track customer’s habits and preferences and can offer highly-contextualized impressions paired with behavioral data. If a user surfs websites about open-ocean fishing, the SSP will categorize those impressions and suggest them to local fishing rod dealers. Advertisers can set up a more cost-effective campaign by using highly targeted inventory that contains located and contextualized impressions. There is a difference between targeting a person in a specific region and targeting fishing enthusiasts who frequently visit the local pond in that region. Those impressions will cost more since they incorporate provider’s fees for data collection and management. Such data services are generally provided by . SSPs partner with DMPs to better segment audiences, analyze traffic and supply impressions with more precise data. The additional costs vary depending on the provider. SSP will appraise those impressions higher, but the advertiser can get a better reach and impact of their ads, and ultimately a higher return on investment. SSP adds another data dimension to offered impressions by supplying them with the exact location, context, and defining . Combining the demographic data, such as gender, education, and income level with nuances of user's behavior, allow advertisers to determine affinities and intents of the potential clients. SSPs enhance offered impressions with contextual information on audience habits, movements, and preferences allowing advertisers to understand the mindset of the potential clients. Advertisers can better manage their campaigns and tailor their ads to specific segments of their audience. For instance, if the user visits a web page of jewelry stores or high-end clothing shops and has an income of over $150k+ per year, the SSP will categorize this user as a luxury shopper and place it in the corresponding segment. SSP then offers this highly desirable segment to advertisers who sell products in this price range. SSP will usually increase CPM for these kinds of profiles, but the advertisers know who is behind an impression and its real value. Collecting data on the user's behavior is becoming a sensitive topic. A surge in privacy legislation, such as GDPR and the  , constrain the use of tracking cookies for targeting and personalizing ads. Advertisers are still working on a solution for a more sustainable and confidential data collection model. Despite this, SSP has a couple of perks that can mitigate this problem. SSPs can build anonymous personas with publisher's data, without ever using personally identifiable information (PII). Publishers don't need to give away personal and confidential information to increase the yield from their inventory. Instead, publishers build anonymous contextual personas based on the user's activities. It combines demographic data with a breakdown of movements and daily activities without violating a consumer's privacy. A persona does not have a customer's PII; instead, it tells more about the character and intentions of the website visitor. Personas enable the SSP to convey a lot of information about the audience to prospective buyers while keeping users anonymous and protecting their privacy. Google's decision to phase out third-party cookies has raised havoc with advertisers and publishers. Website owners who traded their ad space with the assistance of third-party cookies now have to reconsider their data collection model. For many mid-size publishers, which don't rely on registration for user data, the resurgence of  . Instead of tracking users' behavior, this model analyzes the content and intent of the web page and serves the most fitting ad. This targeting approach works best if the publishers use programmatic platforms from the same end-to-end ecosystem. The demand-side platform, or DSP, is a point of entry into the programmatic ecosystem for advertisers. DSP is a software that allows brands, ad networks, and agencies to purchase ad spaces from publishers programmatically. DSP sets forth the advertiser's requirement about the audience, price, and campaign goals. After that, the platform automatically assesses available ad inventory and bids on the ad spaces that best meet the requirements. A DSP can also   marketing campaigns in real time and dynamically change creatives in the ad space. The widespread adoption of SSPs by publishers improves the quality of publisher-advertiser deals and enhances accountability in these relationships. Similar to what DSPs do for advertisers, SSPs automate the redundant manual procedures prone to human error and streamlines the ad-buying process for publishers. Publishers don't have to engage in direct negotiation with the salesperson and collect manual insertion orders. Instead, they leave the ad selling to a pre-configured automated platform. SSPs offer superior options for user analysis, data profiling, audience management, and segmentation. Through SSPs, publishers can provide more detailed insights into their audience, enabling advertisers to precisely target their ad campaigns to the most suitable viewers.\xa0 ", "In the world of advertising, ad-buying is just part of the job. Advertisers usually buy traffic through multiple publishers, and at some point, it becomes extremely difficult to manage all the traffic sources. How can advertisers avoid the headache of tracking multiple channels at once? By using ad servers. Ad servers are the perfect ad management platforms for  . There are countless benefits of   with an ad server. With a decent  , advertisers who manage ads with huge amounts of traffic can track their advertising campaigns across multiple screens and store the aggregated information of their performance all in one place. Any advertiser who deals with multiple ad networks, publishers and dozens of other platforms, should consider how an ad server can help optimize their campaigns. In this article, you’ll discover how to use an ad server in your programmatic advertising campaigns so you can create your own   strategy. Let’s go through the five key benefits of an ad server for advertisers. With programmatic technology scaling up in second half of 2019, advertisers are going the extra mile to walk users through the entire purchase funnel. This article will show you five major benefits of ad server that will help you scale up your advertising in 2019. The performance of every programmatic ad campaign is measured in conversions. The ability to track the targeted actions of the users for further performance optimization can tremendously improve the efficiency of the media buying process. For an advertiser, it’s crucial to know exactly where their best-performing audience is, as they would put more marketing budget into these sources rather than spending money on an audience that would never convert. Keep things on an even keel by   and make sure you get what you paid for. The best part of all is that in most ad servers, performance optimization in the vast majority of ad servers is done automatically. Real-time analytics in an ad server is vital when you deal with dozens or even hundreds of ad campaigns. In this rapidly changing digital world, advertisers should make decisions immediately after the user has engaged with their ad. Ad Servers help to track and measure ad performance by collecting data regarding ad serving activity: browser, OS, referrer, screen size, mobile carrier, time zone, location, etc.In your ad server account, you can now see every conversion in real-time. Why real-time stats are so important? Analytics provides you a 360-degree view on your ad campaign and helps you to maintain better control over the three major advertising concerns: ad fraud, brand safety, and visibility: Fraud can affect even both world-known sites and premium publisher properties. Seventy-seven percent of marketing leaders are concerned about ad fraud for a reason: brands lose at least   because of ad fraud. Ad servers usually partner with fraud protection companies and have built-in fraud detection tools so you can detect fraud with the naked eye. When you see 2,000,000 impressions and zero conversions in your ad campaign, it’s a red flag which may need further examination. The delivery of ads in any format – rich media, display, video should be matched with the relevant website content. Brand safety is a major concern for brands and advertisers: 63% of advertisers are  to ad fraud and dodgy content. Viewability shows the percentage of ads seen by a user. A valid impression must be shown at  . Ad viewability is highly affected by creative type, size, and page design. If you see 1000 ad impressions, 500 of which are counted as viewable, the viewability rate of the website would be 50%. Wondering how your viewability rate measures up to the average? Here are the average global ad viewability rates: Every data-driven decision should be based on large-scale campaign performance data. Real-time reports can save your budgets on third-party market research and make you independent from publisher stats, in which you can't control or eliminate certain traffic resources immediately. In your ad server account, getting customized reports with the metrics that matter to your company will help you re-shape your ad strategies and optimize your efforts for maximum yield. Ad servers generate timely reports across multiple advertising segments and keep them all in one place to give you a complete view of your ad performance. In your ad serving account, you can apply special filters to run reports on specific parameters, cookies, time zones, referral domains, or packages. You can also schedule reports and receive timely updates on key information about your advertising. Conversion tracking in an ad server account shows advertisers how many views or clicks result in a sign-up/registration, actual purchase, lead, viewing of a certain page, or some other valuable actions. \xa0of users convert during the first visit to an online store. The main goal of retargeting campaigns is to make the other 98% come back at the stage they left by showing them custom ads with the item they interacted with. Retargeting can help you keep your brand in front of those users who left your website without a purchase. Retargeting is must-feature for e-commerce companies and brands that sell goods online. With the help of an ad server, advertisers can gather and segment audiences for building smarter communication strategies with every customer. Ad servers then allow them to hit audiences with specific ads and get people back right at the stage where they left (to the website, cart or payment page). This strategy allows advertisers to avoid wasting budget on ads and get straight to the point. When your programmatic advertising budgets and channels grow, it's becoming more vital to keep an eye on your outcome.   will help you keep your online advertising under control and turn it into a cost-effective tool that drives higher quality sales and leads.

Doesn’t it sound like an F1 race to you? No, my friend. It sounds like you, chasing your deadlines and tasks, trying to finish them all in time but to no avail. Time passes by, and you are left with a never-ending list of tasks. Is that you? Unfortunately, it is not the only sign that your are struggling to be productive. What can you do to overcome procrastination and boost your productivity? What signs clearly show you that it’s high time to start working more efficiently? Follow our checklist and find out whether you should fight for productivity and let the procrastinator inside of you go. If you answer “yes” to any of those points, your productivity can be – or already is – in danger. We’ve all been there and done that. You may miss one or two deadlines, sure. Sometimes there are some external reasons that impact missing deadlines, sometimes it could be just your laziness that says “later, mate”. However, if it occurs frequently, then you may have reason to worry.\xa0 Missing too many deadlines can mean two things. The first is about having too many tasks that you are responsible for. The second is that you have a problem with managing your time, if the number of tasks sounds about right. How to overcome it? There are many tools for   or time tracking that could support your everyday tasks. While they won’t start working for you overnight, they may help you take back your control and be productive again in some time, step-by-step.\xa0 Does it ring a bell? Instead of having a short but sweet meeting, you spend two or three hours, gossiping about another department perhaps. Nothing is sorted, no further steps are planned, no (or very little) feedback is given, but at least you caught up with the latest news and rumors. No one is going to give you this wasted time back or do your tasks for you. Meetings like this result in low productivity and being covered with tasks even more than before. The solution? While some people may simply advise you not to attend meetings, you know that it may not be possible. Resign from those meetings that are not necessary, reduce the number of meetings a week and replace them with online communication or introduce daily standups. Spending an hour on a meeting when you are incredibly busy does not sound like a way of making your work a breeze. How come that in the past you could have been focused on huge tasks, and nowadays you are nothing but scatterbrained? If you can’t focus enough concentration on everyday tasks, it impacts the time of their delivery and the quality of the work you’ve done. There is no golden rule that can be applied here in terms of boosting productivity, but it does not mean that you have excuses not to try out a few ways of overcoming this problem. What are the common bottlenecks? Total silence – or noise, even if it’s your favorite song. It can turn out that you love it so much that you focus on getting all of the lyrics right or even recalling some memories related to the music instead of focusing on work. Identifying potential bottlenecks can help you come back to a satisfying level of concentration. A real killer of productivity is the approach. Automation of some tedious tasks is the key to success. No matter how much you do not believe nor want to start using tools, you’ll end up investing in some since they can strengthen your productivity. If you are a G-Suite user, you may struggle with   with others, but there are some available tools that can help you. If you are a social media manager, you may spend ages on planning posts manually – when you can instead use a social media workflow suite to support this process for you and make   easier. If you can’t handle customer support, and your clients wait for your response for ages, consider building a special   you use for  . It can answer frequently asked questions and support your clients while you are not available for them to help. Spending time on tasks that can take minutes instead of days is a nail in the coffin for productivity and being efficient at work.\xa0 If you don’t even know what time it is, then it may be a clear sign for you to slow down and work on your productivity. Being overwhelmed with tasks often comes down to inefficient task management that negatively affects productivity. It results in starting many tasks but finishing only a few of them. You're overworked, you can’t fall asleep, and even if you do, you sleep terribly. Your personal life is nonexistent or is pretty boring because you take on more tasks than you're able to complete, or you take on tasks that you need some help with. Your productivity suffers. Does that sound like your life? Consider getting rid of some tasks or delegate them to your team members. It doesn’t have to mean the end of the world.\xa0 Discover incredibly useful ways to balance your work and life all at once – with a little help from your friends at G2.\xa0 You know you have tasks, but you don’t know what the details or deadlines are. Your tasks hide between sticky notes and some online tools, which results in a constant mess. On top of that, you focus on micromanagement of your team’s performance instead of looking at your own processes. You can’t become a productivity boss in one day, so before you start checking the progress of tasks that are delegated to other team members, look at your own tasks first. Sad, brutal, but true. Do you find yourself complaining all the time about your work? Change it – or change your approach, since it definitely isn’t helping your productivity. It honestly may sound like a terrible piece of advice, but sometimes it is enough to stop complaining and start rolling up your sleeves to work. Complaining can be the worst enemy of productivity. A lack of productivity often goes along with a lack of motivation or low satisfaction from your work. There can be quite a few reasons behind it – one of them is that you can’t really see any goal of what you’ve been doing. This can negatively affect your deliverables. Seeing the bigger picture is crucial for your success, but also for your productivity. If you don’t see any sense in what you are doing, it will reflect in your work. If you understand that every single task you accomplish is a part of something bigger, you can be more productive and overcome any lack of motivation. You used to deliver amazing content. You used to provide readers with added value. It would have been unheard of if you had to submit something of poor quality, but now it happens every day. You prepare your work in a rush and without much motivation or lacking enough time for proper research, which results in low quality work that you don’t even want to sign off on. That’s a no-no, and a clear sign for you to work on your productivity. Move some of your tasks or divide them into a couple of smaller tasks to make your work process easier and smoother. For example, if you’re in charge of writing an article, dedicate a few hours a day to research, and then start working on the actual article the following day. The third day in the content creation pipeline should be spent on proofreading. It probably sounds and looks better than a huge task called “writing an ebook”. Accomplishing smaller tasks can resemble a series of small wins, and it can motivate you to finish your work on time, and in outstanding quality. It is not a walk in the park to actually admit that you need some help with productivity. In many cases, people simply try to find other reasons that can impact a lack of motivation and yes, in many cases it can be easily explained. But if you don’t see why the level of your productivity is so low, it is high time for you to look for a reason and eliminate its negative impact. It may take some time, it will take some effort, but it will pay off with productivity you never know you always missed.\xa0 ", 'Time is one of the few things you can never get back once it’s gone; that’s what makes it one of your most precious resources. Wasted minutes can turn into wasted hours if you’re not paying attention. And while it’s nice to lose an entire afternoon watching Netflix every once in a while, you shouldn’t make a habit of it. Time management is one of those things that some people just seem to have a knack for. The good news is that with the right skills and dedication, you can become a master of time management. People often mistake time management with meticulous minute-by-minute planning. That’s not what this article is about. Instead of becoming hyper-focused on optimizing every moment of your life, the goal is to find a schedule that works best for you. Time management is important for a number of reasons. Often, time management issues stem from more complicated problems. Procrastination, issues with delegating tasks, and issues with focusing all converge to create roadblocks with staying on task. Time management doesn’t discriminate between your personal and professional life; it encompasses everything you do with your day. It’s not about forcing more time into your day – it’s about holistically making the most of the time you already have. If you’re not a morning person now, you’re certainly not going to start waking up at 5 a.m. to go to the gym. Time management works within your schedule and with your goals to create the best version of your day-to-day. Everyone from a stay-at-home parent to a   uses time management. Time doesn’t discriminate, and everyone can afford to use their time better. Whether your day-to-day includes going to school or jet-setting around the world for business, we all only have 24-hours in the day. Even people like Beyoncé have a limited amount of time each day to accomplish their goals (and sell over 118 million records, just saying!) The longer you wait to create better strategies for managing your time the harder it will be to break those habits later on. You might be asking yourself,  That’s a fair question! Most people don’t realize they have a time management problem at first. The thing to remember is that time management problems often disguise themselves as other problems. If you have issues focusing at work or you consistently miss deadlines, you might have a problem with managing your time. Even if you don’t identify with any of the problems above, you could likely be managing your time better. You don’t have to be floundering to adopt better time management strategies. The work of time management is never truly done. There’s always something you can plan better or work on improving. Time management is such a popular concept that it has produced many specific methodologies over the years. While some have come and gone, there are three popular ones that many consider the ”Holy Trinity” of time management. The  , more commonly known as the 4 Ds of time management, can be broken down into four simple components:  This method revolves around the idea that everything you spend your time doing falls into two main categories: urgent/not urgent and important/unimportant. Under the Eisenhower method, tasks that are considered important and urgent should be at the top of your   while tasks that are neither urgent nor important can probably be done away with altogether. That table might seem a bit confusing but in reality, it’s simple. Once you understand how to categorize your tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, you can decide how to schedule your day. The most important and urgent tasks can be completed first while the least urgent and important can be left for later if you have time. The  , also known as the  , was crafted with the idea that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. This method focuses on the 20% of efforts that impact the largest portion of your outcomes. It’s about taking a full assessment of your workflows and creating maximum efficiencies by going all in on your best assets. Let’s say you have a website and you’re looking to optimize your content to boost your organic website visits. The Pareto principle would suggest you find the articles driving the most visits to your website and focus on those as opposed to optimizing everything. By focusing on your top-performing articles (20%) that drive the most traffic (80%), you can drive more actionable results with less effort. Does that mean those other articles on your website are worthless? No. It just means they aren’t a priority for this specific project. The  is a five-step process designed to help you manage your time better. This method was modeled after  . Basically, you complete tasks in the order that are more important to finish and put the least important tasks at the end. POSEC stands for  rioritizing by  rganizing,  treamlining,  conomizing, and  ontributing.  simply means you put the most important things first. That could be as simple as creating a list and ranking your tasks from most to least important, then completing them in that order.  means you lay out a strategy for how you’re going to complete these tasks. This helps your goals feel more attainable and it makes tasks easier to complete. When you have a strategy for how things get done, they get done faster.  focuses on the tasks that you don’t want to do, but need to get done. Cleaning your dishes, folding your laundry, and so on. These are the mundane tasks that can’t be ignored. Streamlining is designed to get them done quicker and more effectively so you can focus on the important tasks at hand.  refers to tasks that you enjoy doing. These are your hobbies and your leisure activities. While these might be the most fun to do, they’re not needed. You should place these tasks at the bottom of your to-do list.  includes your social obligations. This can include attending a friend’s party or volunteering at an animal shelter. These tasks include other people relying on you, so they tend to be placed higher on the list than solo projects. People who excel at time management all have one thing in common. It’s not that they’re smarter or naturally gifted, it’s that they’ve created a system that works for them. There’s no uniform time management strategy that works for everyone. But with the right skills, you can find a way to manage time that works best for you. Staying organized is the most important skill to have when utilizing time management. This means organizing your schedule, your priorities, your obligations, and more. Find a way to organize all of your most important information in one place. Once you’ve organized everything it’s time to prioritize your tasks. The most important things should be at the top of your to-do list. Try creating a short-list of three “must-dos” every morning before you leave your house. No matter how hectic things get you can refer to those most vital tasks as your source of what needs to get done. You’re likely going to run into tasks that need to get done but aren’t a priority — this is where delegation comes in. Whether at work or home, you can delegate these less important tasks to other people. If nobody else is available to do them you can always defer these tasks for later. Forgetting to schedule downtime for yourself is a huge mistake. Time management encompasses every part of your life, including your Monday night Bachelor watching session! Don’t feel guilty about allowing yourself time to decompress and just chill every once in awhile. You’re not the only person who needs to be aware of your time management. Your partner, your children, your coworkers, and your friends need to be aware of your strategy. Communicate your boundaries with people and stick firm to them. Don’t let others pressure you into breaking a good habit. Setting goals for yourself helps you stay accountable. Try starting small by scheduling a few key things to get done each week. Once you’ve got the hang on that, you can focus on longer term goals for yourself. Maybe you want to spend more time reading? Or get more done at work? These are all goals that time management can help you achieve. The obvious benefit of time management is that you’ll have more time in your day to get things done. But there are other more subtle advantages to managing your time better. These perks can help you immensely in both your personal and professional life. This one is a no-brainer. When you spend less time focusing on how you’re going to get everything done, your stress levels decrease significantly. Planning and executing your schedule without procrastination gives you more time to do the things you love doing, instead of worrying about how you’re going to do all the things you need to do. Creating a schedule and executing tasks on a timeline will improve the quality of your work. Knowing what you’re getting done allows you to be fully present in the moment. You don’t have to worry about pre-planning and can focus on completing your work instead. When you use your time more effectively, you actually get more time back. Those wasted minutes you used to spend checking your phone or avoiding work add up. This means you can take on more projects, new hobbies, or even time to just relax. The world opens up once you take control of your time. One of the biggest side-effects of poor time management is an unbalanced work and home life. If you find yourself taking work home with you every night there’s a chance you have a problem with wasting time at work. Better time management at work will free up your personal life. When you stop taking work home with you it can give you more time for your hobbies, your spouse, your children, or your pets. It’s a win-win for every aspect of your life! Making the most of your time is tricky. There will always be things in your life that you absolutely have to do. Picking your kids up from school, making dinner, and showering are things that take up time that you can’t just stop doing. Making the most of your time is an invaluable skill that can benefit every aspect of your life.  is a popular project management strategy where you block off large sections of your calendar every day for a specific activity. Time blocking encourages you to focus on what needs to get done and sets an expectation for when these tasks will be completed. It can be done in your online calendar or even a personal planner. Here’s an example of what a time blocked schedule looks like compared to an open calendar: Notice how there are scheduled breaks in-between these large blocks of time? This allows you space to do other things as they come up throughout the day. What makes time blocking great is that it also communicates to other people when you are busy, which lessens the chance for distractions during the day. You might be shocked to learn this, but multitasking is actually making your time management worse. Some studies report that multitasking can cause projects to take as much as   than if you’d just focused on a singular task. Those same studies suggest that only 2.5% of the entire population falls under the category of “supertaskers” who are able to multitask effectively. If you think you might be one of those supertaskers, you’re probably not. Once again, studies show that people who   they’re great at multitasking are often the worst of us all. You’re better off sticking to one task at a time and finishing it to completion. Procrastination is one of the toughest parts of time management. It’s very easy to fall into the mindset of “doing things later”. We all know what can happen when you push everything off to do later. You’ll need to face your procrastination head-on if you want to get better at managing your time. Here are four steps to help you kick your procrastination habit: Don’t let yourself get into a shame spiral over procrastination. We all do it from time to time. Focus on what you’re doing to overcome the urge to push things off. Create a plan and stick to it. You might be surprised how easy it is to beat procrastination with a little mindfulness! For many of us, technology falls into the category of distractions. But in some cases, it can actually help you manage your time better. If you’re looking to manage your personal life better there are tons of   that you can download directly to your phone. These apps range from calendar apps to scheduling tools and more! For professionals looking to manage their time better there are more than 750 project management software options available on the market. These tools allow you to create workflows, tag teammates in new projects, and track your time more effectively. Find the best   on the market based on real user reviews from people like you. It’s impossible to manage your time better if you don’t know what you’re using your time for. Spend a full week tracking your day-to-day in a planner or calendar. Write down what you’re doing throughout the day whether it’s eating, napping, or working. Once you have the full picture of how you spend your time, it’s easier to decide what can stay and what can go. Learning how to say no will save you a lot of trouble. As we mentioned earlier in the Eisenhower Decision Matrix, not everything is worth your time! Be choosier about what projects you commit your time to and which ones you let fall away. Learning to value your time will make managing your schedule much easier. Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword. Time is often wasted on trying to get the details of a project exactly right, losing valuable time you could use doing something else. You can counteract this by setting a predetermined amount of time to complete a task. If you know you only have an hour to get something done, you’re less likely to waste time on other things. You know how some people meal prep their entire week of meals on Sunday? You can do the same thing with your time. Sit down and time block each day of your week every Sunday evening. This sets a schedule you can stick to and frees up time in your schedule. Then, you can spend the first 15 minutes of each day reviewing your time blocks and adjusting for anything that came up since you scheduled things. Planning ahead and adjusting daily will add up to hours saved over time. Nothing beats a good old-fashioned planner. It’s your lifeline for what’s happening when. Some people prefer to use a physical planner while others go the digital route. No matter which option you choose, a planner will keep you accountable for sticking to the schedule you create for yourself. One of the biggest reasons people procrastinate is they dread doing a difficult or time-consuming task. You can break this habit by getting those demanding tasks out of the way first. Once you’re over the hill of your most difficult projects, everything else will seem like a breeze! Plus, it gives you a sense of accomplishment that can boost your energy for the rest of the day. You don’t have to spend every second of every day on a schedule. It’s important to pencil in time to relax with your family or watch your favorite Netflix show. Try giving yourself one day a week where you don’t schedule anything to do. Let the day take you where it will and just go with the flow. This helps you recharge your batteries and prevent burnout. There’s a good chance that you’ll encounter someone who tries to derail your time management habits. Whether that’s a coworker or family member, you need to establish firm boundaries with them. This could mean saying no to ineffective or bad meetings, or reminding your spouse that you need time to complete certain tasks. Staying firm in your plan is crucial to your success. Once you’ve mastered the art of time management, your days of yearning for a time machine will be a thing of the past. You’re in charge of your time. It might take some serious adjusting at first but utilize these tools and you’ll reclaim your time before you know it! ', 'For many, "being productive" is at odds with getting a good night\'s rest. Here\'s why you won\'t get one without the other. If you\'re looking for ways to  , it\'s unlikely you\'re thinking about sleep, or its biological cousin, the circadian rhythm. Yet both are – perhaps counterintuitively – fundamental to being productive, feeling good, and performing at your best. To understand why your productivity derives from sleep. Or, to be more specific, meeting your sleep need and your circadian rhythm, you need to know about the Two Laws of Sleep, known to sleep scientists as the " ”. The first law pertains to   the difference between the amount of sleep you get and the amount of sleep you need, over a roughly 14-day period. Each of us has a genetically-determined sleep need, just like our height. The average need is eight hours and 10 minutes. Most of us require between   of sleep per night.  is the single most important metric when it comes to your sleep. Every negative consequence you\'ve heard about from lack of sleep – be it physical, emotional, or cognitive – redounds to the amount of sleep debt you\'re carrying. Critically, sleep debt and its impacts start to mount immediately with \'short\' sleep. As professor of neuroscience and sleep expert Matt Walker writes in  : The consequences of sleep debt for productivity are particularly acute. This is because the “ ” of the brain – mental processes like reasoning, problem-solving, and decision making, all of which are essential to performing our jobs – are governed by the prefrontal cortex, which is severely impaired by lack of sleep. While other parts of the brain can cope reasonably well under conditions of sleep deprivation, neuroscientists have found  . Basic visual and motor skills, for example, directed by the occipital and cerebellum lobes of the brain respectively, degrade when sleep is deprioritized, but they do so not nearly to the same extent as these higher-order mental skills. The second law of sleep concerns the circadian rhythm. One of the best ways to understand the circadian rhythm is as a biological clock that governs when every cell in your body should be active or at rest. Your circadian rhythm tells you when to be awake and when to be asleep – affecting the duration of your sleep and what your brain does at night. It also modulates our waking behavior, affecting peaks and dips in energy throughout the day. As such, it has direct bearing on a number of  , including our ability to pay attention, learn new skills, memorize and recall, the building blocks of productivity. Circadian misalignment, such as when you’re jetlagged, or not keeping regular sleep hours, is associated with   and other deleterious mental and   outcomes. We\'ll explore how to take advantage of your circadian rhythm for productivity a little later. First, we\'ll return to the concept of sleep debt and detail exactly how it undermines cognitive performance. There’s almost 100 years of sleep science exploring the negative impact of sleep debt on workplace performance. This research reveals: Sleep debt also degrades productivity by undermining our emotional control and thus interpersonal and team dynamics. With sleep deprivation comes: If sleep is so important to productivity, why don\'t organizations, leaders, and we ourselves prioritize it? The answer is complex and multifaceted, but here\'s our take. First, there\'s our broad societal apathy towards sleep. "I\'ll sleep when I\'m dead" is a maxim of the corporate lexicon. Not only does the American business community view sleep as expendable, we imprudently   who profess to go without. Caffeine may be another reason, since we can use it to very effectively  . What most people don\'t know is that caffeine stays in your system for 10 hours, and can trigger a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation when consumed too late in the day. The most interesting reason by far, however, is what sleep scientists have shown to be our human inability to correctly assess our own sleepiness and resulting performance declines. Indeed, if you\'re reading this and thinking you don\'t need between seven and nine hours of sleep a night or don\'t see your lack of sleep affecting your productivity, you\'re wrong – but you\'re not alone. There\'s been a sizable amount of research into this phenomenon and it shows significantly sleep-deprived individuals tend to  . As study participants become more sleep deprived, their subjective sleepiness plateaus while their actual performance linearly declines. This  : The great news is that improving our sleep – and reaping the rewards for productivity – is in our control. So is taking advantage of your circadian rhythm. Before we dive into how to get the sleep you need, as well as how to time your activities with your circadian rhythm, a quick note about "sleep quality". Understanding the mechanics of sleep debt, your circadian rhythm, and how they work together to support productivity is the educational foundation to support changing your behavior to prioritize sleep. Given the extent to which the various sleep stages have made their way into everyday conversation, it\'s worth noting why our emphasis is on sleep debt, or the quantity of sleep you\'re getting, and not on the time spent in REM, light sleep, or deep sleep – a breakdown often equated with sleep quality. The reason we talk about sleep debt, a measure of quantity, is that none of those other variables (restlessness, REM, deep, etc.) have an impact on how you\'re going to feel or perform the next today. In fact, there\'s   from sleep and machine learning scientists at Stanford: they took all of the best "sleep quality" data from polysomnography (the gold standard when it comes to measuring sleep) to figure out if they can predict how you feel in the morning. Turns out, they can\'t. This is not to say that the stages of sleep aren\'t important – they are, very much so, but there are three things to know: To fall asleep and stay asleep, your sleeping environment must be conducive to sleep. It’s recommended to make your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet, like a cave. And now, to return to your circadian rhythm. As we\'ve discussed, meeting your sleep need  . The other key lever is your circadian rhythm. When it comes to thinking about how your circadian rhythm affects your daily energy levels, it helps to visualize the number 3 or a lowercase m, tipped to its side – an illustration of the rolling wave of energy peaks and dips we experience over the course of the day. Everyone has two natural energy peaks per day. For many, these fall in the late morning and late afternoon. These are times when your body is alert and ready to perform. Similarly, everyone has two energy dips per day. The first occurs in the early afternoon and the second comes in the evening as we wind down for bed. This is when your body is naturally relaxed and in recovery. If you’re carrying sleep debt, you will feel these dips more profoundly. Low to no sleep debt will optimize the peaks. When you experience these peaks and dips depends on light exposure and your chronotype. Your chronotype – a product of your age, gender, and genetics –\xa0 is the “bias” of your internal clock, relative to society’s 24-hour clock. Late chronotypes, or “night owls” have an internal clock longer than 24 hours. Early chronotypes or “morning larks” have an internal clock shorter than 24 hours. What’s important to note is that your energy schedule is unique to you and it will be slightly different every day, depending on your exposure to light. Understanding your circadian rhythm is key to truly being productive. Rather than try to indiscriminately accomplish tasks throughout the day, you can now   based on the amount of focus and energy they require. Here’s what a daily routine, optimized for productivity, might look like: As energy levels ramp, plan your day. Review your inbox. Check Slack. Sip that single origin coffee or some fresh pressed black tea to ease that morning grogginess, but limit your caffeine intake as the day continues. Getting sunlight first thing is essential. Pairing that with exercise will help with that night’s sleep. This is the time for work that requires your highest level of focus--strategizing, pitching, connecting with clients or prospects--or most emotionally-demanding activities, like prospecting and dealing with obstacles or rejections. Reserve this time for administrative items like emails or CRM updates, a company all-hands, or webinar watching. This energy lull you feel after lunch is part of a normally-functioning circadian rhythm and not a food hangover! On the weekends, consider household chores, exercise, or a nap for this time. Use this peak for another high-focus project or collaborative effort before starting your evening wind-down. Although it\'s easy to find ourselves working round-the-clock, the science shows that an evening wind-down promotes quality sleep which, in turn, increases next-day productivity. Activities that will prime your body for sleep including taking a hot shower, reading, or implementing evidence-based relaxation strategies like Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR). During this wind-down it’s important to reduce blue light (which suppresses melatonin so you stay awake longer). Turn your devices to “Night Shift,” cap screen time and if Netflix is a must, put on your blue-light blocking orange glasses. It’s also a good idea to limit stress or excitement-inducing activities. There’s an entire industry devoted to “hacking” productivity. The truth is, none of these hacks will work until you’ve reduced your sleep debt and scheduled your activities with your circadian rhythm.

Metrics help   understand what the turn-offs that stop visitors from checking out are.\xa0 In this post, you’ll find out how to measure the success of an e-commerce store with a full guide for becoming a pro in analyzing CLV, CAC, ad views, and other   success metrics. Business owners can often confuse metrics and  , as the two are often mentioned together. The difference is subtle. However, it’s crucial to understand the context both terms are used in.\xa0 Choosing the right metrics helps business managers prioritize marketing activities, increases awareness of lead generation bottlenecks, and understand the pace at which a company is reaching its goals.\xa0 There are dozens of benchmarks e-commerce companies can track. Analyzing metrics and building a big picture view of the business’ performance is time-consuming; that’s why we narrowed the list of data points to track to 7 performance indicators.\xa0 Here are the metrics that will give you an understanding of how efficiently you’re running a business.\xa0 Customer lifetime value is the number of money users spent since their first purchase.\xa0 The metric helps business owners understand how well they are connecting to customers, brings insight into the target audience’s average income, and helps estimate how much an average shopper is willing to pay for a product.\xa0 Usually, business managers use up to 30 percent of CLV for customer acquisition. For every $100 of value, you will be able to invest 30 percent to get new clients.\xa0 Customer acquisition cost calculates how much you spent for every first-time purchase. To achieve financial feasibility, you have to make sure that the company’s CAC is as low as possible.\xa0 Business managers use multiple e-commerce distribution channels and marketing mediums – social media, email, PPC ads, TV ads, and so on. Some of them might be cheap and efficient while others could be draining the company’s budget with no return. Calculating customer acquisition cost per marketing channel helps business managers track the efficiency of all promotional activities.\xa0 The recommended CAC value is 30 percent of customer lifetime value. Usually, marketers calculate acquisition cost per promotion channel (Facebook, Google Adwords, email marketing, etc.).\xa0 A customer retention rate shows how many customers leave repeated orders after the first purchase.\xa0 Low CRR is a warning sign that could indicate poor quality of the product or customer service. By failing to retain customers, you lose the possibility to build a dedicated audience and increase the company’s revenue. In most industries, the retention rate of 25 percent is quite high. For some industries, like  , the rate of 35 percent is an average estimate.\xa0 The average order value shows you the size of your customers’ average cheques. It is a useful metric for getting to know the financial status of your target audience and seeing how much a shopper is willing to spend on your product.\xa0 Knowing your company’s average order value gives managers insights on how to improve pricing strategies and encourage shoppers to leave with full carts.\xa0 High order values are different across industries; you will need to decide for yourself if your AOV corresponds to your company’s goals and benchmarks. Be sure to compare the average order values on a monthly basis to see if the company is reliant on seasonal trends and optimize marketing activities accordingly.\xa0 Product returns are common for e-commerce stores. Sometimes, a customer gets a product as an impulse purchase and, after giving it a second thought, returns it. There are cases, however, when shoppers are disappointed in the quality of the product and have no other way out than to return it.\xa0 For e-commerce managers, high return rates are a warning sign. You are either targeting the wrong audience, positioning your product the wrong way, or don’t follow the best manufacturing practices.\xa0Tracking the metric gives product managers the possibility to see room for improving the line.\xa0 Amazon and other big e-commerce giants consider a 10 percent return rate normal.

In order to keep the lights on, your company needs to be able to engage, persuade, and maintain a steady amount of customers, all while providing a unique and personal experience. While you could guess what your customers are interested in and how they respond to different forms of engagement, think of all of the customer data you have at your fingertips with the right  . Then, think about how you can use customer analytics. It seems obvious to take the time to track these analytics. But the   that many teams are keeping an eye on are only a fraction of the data available about their customers. Customer analytics is the use of data to further understand anything and everything about your customers, from how satisfied they are with your products to their buying behaviors. It seems simple enough: collecting quality data analytics about your customers leads to the use of powerful software solutions and the knowledge of intelligent people to produce analytics. Analytics lead to actionable insight; in turn, you get to make better decisions, resulting in more ROI. So why isn’t everyone measuring these metrics? The bottom line is because data comes from almost everywhere, whether it’s from the software you use, the notes you take, or the observations you make. In tandem, the analytics resulting from that data present the same issue: it takes a lot of critical thinking to understand the importance of customer analytics while identifying and gathering insights from them. The importance of customer analytics is simple: the more you understand your customers, the better you’ll be able to make decisions about the way you price your products, communicate with your customers, and work internally as a team. The smarter the decisions you make, the more successful your business will be, and the happier your customers will be in the long run. If you invest your time digging into customer data, you’ll not only be able to gain insights which may be able to help predict future interactions your customers will have with you, but also help shift your own strategy in regards to how you interact with them so that you can provide a more meaningful experience. Today, consumers are experienced; they know what they want.  of consumers expect a seamless brand experience, want rapid responses, and desire support on the channel they feel is appropriate for them. Keep in mind: every customer is different. How can a company possibly cater to all of the individual profiles that are brought to the table? By leveraging customer analytics. It often goes without saying that the knowledge you have about your customer can be the key to your business' success. The more information your business collects around your customers, the better you’ll be able to handle obstacles that already exist, advance your current approaches as well as predict and prepare for the future. Below, we've laid out some of the values that customer analytics have the potential to provide. When you’re looking to keep customers happy for the long-term and have them coming back for more of your products or services, customer retention can be a huge help. Since it’s five times more expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to retain a current one, boosting your company’s customer retention can mean more money towards your budget that can be spent on other marketing efforts.\xa0 When you utilize analytics that are centered around your customers, you’ll be making the necessary effort to listen to your customers and act on their needs in real-time. When you ignore this data, a customer will feel like they’re not being listened to and that their needs aren’t being met. When this happens, current customers become former customers – fast. One way to help boost your customer retention as a way to make the most of customer analytics is to utilize  . When you get real-time data surrounding your customers, as well as your products and competitors, you can make every decision a confident one. With G2 Insight Subscription, it’s just one more way you can know for sure what your customer analytics are telling you and the smartest ways to act on this data. Knowing your customer segments like the back of your hand is great. Once you have all of that information, what do you do with it? Often, the details pulled from those segments are only enough to provide a blurred image of what steps marketers should be taking next. Instead of making educated guesses based on theories, customer analytics can tell you exactly where your customers are spending time online, when they're active, what social media platforms they use, and indicate how you can best approach them to get the results you're looking for. Nobody wants to lose a customer; not only is it disheartening, but it's expensive. With customer analytics, your team can choose to pay attention to the signs of unhappy customers or entire market segments. By doing this, you're creating an opportunity for your team to develop the changes that are necessary and more appropriately adapt to those customers who you may be at risk of losing. Unsure how to take it one step further? Implement  .

And because you’re able to send out a more personalized message, your campaigns will utilize customer marketing analytics and speak to their exact and unique needs. Delivering one message to a diverse audience might work if you know each of those individuals is a loyal customer. Unfortunately, the odds of that happening aren't so common. Instead, customer analytics can be leveraged to increase customer loyalty and response rates at the same time by contacting customers with offers and messages more catered to them. Customer analytics can tell you more about your customers in the present so that you can determine how to better interact with them in the future. While customer analytics can benefit any industry, we’ve listed examples of some that can benefit the most – and how – below. It’s imperative that your marketing team take a deep dive into customer analytics as a way to make the most of their marketing campaigns. Customer marketing analytics can be used as a strategy for gaining insights as a way to deliver top-notch customer experiences that are tailored to the specific preferences and needs of your customers. Most customers know that companies collect data on them, and in turn they expect personalized interactions as a result of this data, while also being sent relevant information and offers. When your marketing team uses customer analytics, they can be used as a solution to customer demands for predictive modeling,  , and so much more.\xa0 The stronger and more accurate your customer marketing analytics are, the better and more effective the customer journey and the more accurate the customer insights will be. Not only can your marketing team leverage this data to increase customer loyalty, but also to boost the customer lifetime value, and gain a complete view of their actions across various channels.\xa0 Being one of, if not the most customer-facing industry, there are infinite ways that retail can benefit from using customer analytics. For example, marketers can use customer   to determine which platforms are most popular among segments, and then deliver personalized messages across those platforms to optimize the way they reach their customers as well as the offers they provide them with. Customer analytics can also help indicate customer preferences, which can assist product developers in their next projects. Whether customers are applying for loans or planning money management techniques, banks are constantly working with people to better their futures. Because they deal with so many people, customer analytics can come in handy when it comes to improving customer service and interactions with customers. In addition, customer analytics can help banks prevent issues that could arise in the future. For example, using customer analytics to determine characteristics that align with suspicious behavior can help professionals identify dangerous or suspicious behavior before it’s too late. Just like any other data, customer analytics can be leveraged to prove whether or not you’re predicting something correctly, achieving goals, or preparing properly for the future. From the top to the bottom of the sales funnel and all the way through your marketing campaigns, customer analytics can help you answer the questions that managers and C-suite executives may have about those customers, as well as improve upon certain metrics so that you can better achieve your objectives. Finding the answers to these questions and others is the key to excelling as a business, but these answers aren’t easy to find. Having the right tools to collect the data that holds those answers is the next step to creating an accurate customer profile. There are many different ways to gather the types of metrics that come through the door. In fact, any platform that your team uses to collect any kind of data (social media tools, website analytics, survey tools, review platforms) are all opportunities to track customer data. As you’re collecting data, beware of  . In order to avoid tracking vanity metrics, or numbers that will not help you make actionable business decisions in the future, ask yourself these questions: Below are a few examples of types of customer data that can be measured to help you gather insightful analytics as you get to know your customers a little better.  is gathered through repeat purchases of services or products. This is often collected in retail businesses in which every purchase increases the strength of a relationship between a customer and a brand.  can be gathered to learn more about how consumers use products and services so that businesses can make future decisions about how to improve customer experience. Customer behavior analytics results from data that can be collected in multiple ways, such as through research and surveys.  can be collected to keep tabs on every move a customer makes. From the source of the customer down to the amount of time they spend on a specific page, this data can assist a company in creating more relevant content, making pertinent recommendations, and delivering messages in a timely manner. This data can be collected with  , which is capable of tracking the customer journey via most major marketing efforts such as email marketing campaigns, website CTAs, and social media interactions. Of course, the way that these methods are implemented is up to you and your team, the tools you’re already using or willing to learn how to use, and the way that your company operates. No matter what information you choose to collect from your customers, one of the most important steps you should take is ensuring organization. The concept of customer analytics may feel a little abstract, but when you realize how heavily some companies are implementing it, you’ll soon see that you’re missing out on the fun. It’s no surprise that G2 is making the most of customer marketing analytics. We also make it simple for our customers to implement these analytics on a daily basis.\xa0 Let’s dive deeper into a real-life G2 Customer example, Customer X.\xa0 Thanks to Buyer Intent Data, Customer X was able to see Disney appear in their dashboard, looking at their competitors. Since this is usually a sign that a customer is about to churn and give their business to a competing customer, Customer X took action right away, and got Disney on a call to check-in and see how the account was going.\xa0 Because they were able to utilize these analytics and act fast, they saved Disney as an account and not lose out on a massive customer churning to one of their competitors. . That’s an awful lot of people to keep track of, but this media giant knows the value of their customers. Netflix uses data regarding subscriber interactions with movies and TV shows, making note of the date it was watched, what time of day it was, what device they watched it on, and where the show was paused. If the show is paused, Netflix also takes note of whether a viewer resumes the show after pausing, whether people finish a show at all, and if so, how long it took them to do so. What does Netflix do with all of this information? It uses it to recommend   of what’s on your home page. In addition, Netflix uses data and customer experience analytics to create custom experiences. For example, with multiple versions of a movie trailer in their pocket, Netflix will show the one that focuses on the older, male characters to users who watch TV shows that have casts of older, male characters. For users who watch mainly content that contained a particular actor that also happened to be a part of that movie, Netflix would show the version of the trailer that mainly featured that actor. E-commerce giant Amazon has   Prime members, and millions of more ways to get to know them. The most well-known way that Amazon uses big data and customer analytics is with their recommendations. Were you shopping for dog beds? Did you see all of these dog harnesses? Sounds familiar. Amazon does much more than that when it comes to combining big data in with its marketing performance. Based on what you highlight in your Kindle, Amazon interprets what you like to learn about, and that’s how they make book recommendations. Amazon also has a patented anticipatory shipping model that predicts the products you’ll likely purchase, when you’ll purchase them, and where you’ll need them. Based on this data, Amazon sends those products to your local distribution center so that they’re ready to be shipped as soon as you order. That’s just the start of what Amazon is doing with their customer data and analytics. With all of the data at our fingertips, it’s no wonder why some brands struggle to sort through it all. But now more than ever, customers value the experience you provide almost as much, if not more than, your product or service. It may sound like a lot of digging to extend the customer lifecycle, but the companies who know their customers like the backs of their hands are the ones who will succeed in the end. ", 'We’ve all heard the phrase, “Results may vary.” This applies to your company’s finances — revenue, budget and spending — as much as anything else. Watching for variance in anticipated spending versus what is actually spent, for example, is critical. Reacting appropriately to these fluctuations, and doing so with accuracy, are keys to success in how you define goals and set expectations — particularly with company finances. Variance is a statistical term that measures the spread between numbers in a set of data. It calculates the distance a random data point is from the mean of the data set. Knowing variance is a critical step in catching poor habits in their early stages, and lending urgency to missed targets or flaws in your corporate planning by putting a round number on the deviations (ex. “We spent 20 percent more than we thought we would,” with 20 percent representing the variance between the final spend and the budget amount.) When a sizable variance is discovered, any negligence or mishandling can spell big-time trouble for your entire operation. On the flip-flop, a variance close to zero is a pat on the back and evidence that your machine is operating as expected. Tracking the variance of various metrics gives you added perspective to make timely decisions, and shift focus to problem areas when the time calls. A number of   tools offer variance calculators and similar tools, but it’s still beneficial for your company’s financial professionals to know the basics of calculating variance, i.e., the central terms and numbers involved as well as understand what these findings indicate for the future. There are variances in profit, spending and other aspects of your business, and they each yield valuable data for the company. If you’ve ever tried to predict a number, but the actual number was different from your guess, you’ve created a variance. Your guess wasn’t right, but you may now have valuable feedback for the future. The basic formula for calculating variance involves some second grade math, but knowing how to correctly apply the formula and respond to the results are what separates the front of the class from the class clowns. In a second, we’ll provide some real-life examples to help you visualize the formula. Before applying the formula, your accounting team (or whoever’s managing the numbers on a given initiative) should log its budgets, planned costs, goals and so on. Accuracy and thoroughness are key. Then, at regular intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly or quarterly), they will calculate the total spend, losses, profits and other corresponding results. Once you have a before-and-after picture of an individual metric and your overall financial health, you can plug these numbers into the variance equation. Make sure you connect the appropriate figures for each desired variance. Your expenditures should be tied to your budget, and your profits should be tied to your projections/estimates. The variances in each should spur different, but equally important, responses from management. Variance can be good news or bad, depending on the situation, aka,   or  . A little variance in either direction is normal, whereas a large variance is newsworthy. If you are trending poorly in your budget but positive in your profits, this works itself out to where you are overall in the green. So that’s cool and all. In any case, your variances impact everything from salaries to advertising, and should factor into your routine financial planning. Here are the most common use-cases of variance in businesses: For starters, let’s look at  . This is the deviation between your estimated profit and your actual profit in a given period of time. Example: You planned to gross $10,000 in January, but you grossed $8,000. When plugged into the variance formula, this gives you a variance of -20 percent. A negative profit variance implies one of two things: Success-minded management teams are liable to spin the story toward No. 2, to keep employees striving for greatness. In reality, both No. 1 and No. 2 are often true in cases of negative variance. The best decision-makers will view a negative result from all angles and make sensible adjustments when mapping out the next fiscal year. Confusingly, a “negative budget variance” is actually a good thing. A positive budget variance, meanwhile, means you went over budget, aka, y’all spent too much. (It can be a bit confusing.  )  is the difference between your scheduled budget — for a department, a single project or event, or the company as a whole — and what you wind up shelling out. Example: You have a budget of $1,000 for supplies, but you spend $1,200. When plugged into the formula, this is a 20 percent variance. It’s   a positive variance. You went 20 percent over budget. (Shame on you!) This is important to know so you can reconsider your budget from every angle. A positive budget variance implies one of two things: 1. You need to spend less or find cheaper alternatives for certain costs. 2. You company has not allocated enough. Again, there may be arguments for both sides of this coin in nearly every scenario. That is up to your management team to decide (perhaps with the help of local  ). But some action will need to be taken, so you don’t continue to spend over budget and lose money willy-nilly. How much are you spending on your inventory? Learn   and how it should influence your budgeting decisions.  is another angle from which to view budget and costs, whether for inventory, staffing, repairs or another item from your laundry list. Also called  , this term describes the difference between a budgeted or planned expense and the final amount. Example: You estimate it will cost $500 to ramp up a new employee, but it only costs $400 in the end. This equals out to a negative expense variance of $100, or -20 percent. Negative expense variance, like negative budget variance, is actually a positive. A given expense cost less than you thought it would. You can take that information into account for future expenses. But don’t blow that $100 you saved just for the heck of it. Have some restraint, people. We’ve gone over a few core concepts of variance as it relates to business. If you’ve got Variance Fever, though, you can roll the concept over to just about any quantifiable aspect of your operation. This can include employee efficiency, head count and labor hours; equipment usage; website traffic and much more. Measuring variance is a super useful way to refine your operation. It’s great to know which areas demand more attention or a different strategy. And the more you track and follow this information, the better. The biggest and best companies in the world know there are lessons to learn from variance. You can never be done evolving or refining your practices and processes. There is no concrete answer as to what constitutes a reasonable variance versus a “sound-the-alarms!” variance. If you’re just getting off the ground, or your company just experienced a major pivot, spike or plunge — whatever the reason may be — you can expect a wider-than-average margin. But, in general, a number close to 1 percent or 0 means the ship is running how it should, particularly as you master the estimating process over time. Developing a firm grasp of your organization’s numbers is a smart play, no matter your industry or size. As you move along, you can dig deeper, by measuring specific performance metrics, operational costs and so on. You can use variance as a barometer for countless decisions. From Day One, you should be closely observing, tracking and organizing your budget, costs, profits and losses. It may sound simple but the importance cannot be overstated. \xa0 '], 46: ["Looking to save a funny text your mom just sent you? A recent Google search that you're planning on referring to later?

You go to book your flight first, and the idea of flying back the same night that your business obligations end is a bit depressing. So the idea hits: bleisure. You book a flight back on Sunday and get a free weekend to hit the beach. Bleisure, one of the hottest  , can add a whole new element of personal travel to a business trip. Suddenly, traveling for work isn’t so bad. The rise of bleisure travel has changed the landscape of business travel for employees, companies, and travel management tools. Before diving into these changes, it’s important to define what bleisure is  in addition to what it  . Bleisure does not mean that you can swap out meetings for sightseeing or expense personal time to the company. It also is not an excuse for expensing personal time for reimbursement from your company. Bleisure is adding time on a trip for personal use and is paid for by the traveler. You should always check with your company’s policy regarding added time before turning one of your scheduled business obligations into a bleisure trip. We’ll examine the various ways bleisure is shifting the business travel landscape from the established ways of going on business trips. The benefits of bleisure can suddenly make the hassle of a business trip turn into a perk of being on the job. Bleisure enables travelers to add an itinerary that excites them onto a pre-existing business trip. In fact, 75% of young professionals now view being able to travel for business as a perk, according to a recent study conducted by  . Bleisure benefits business travelers by providing unique travel opportunities through work. It also benefits companies in industries where travel is plentiful and a necessity of the job. From a traveler’s perspective, a travel assignment can now come with an added element of new sights to see and attractions to explore. From the company’s side, it is now easier to convince your employees of the benefits of traveling for work if they are able to use the benefit of personal time. Millennials are known as a generation that values experiences over things. Travel is of the utmost importance to many with the ability to spend money on leisure, and capitalizing on necessary business trips to provide an easy employee perk is a no-brainer for companies looking to attract young, top talent. The opportunity for bleisure travel not only benefits business travelers themselves, but also attracts business to high-profile cities. Conferences are a great example of this, as they are the most common type of business trip that is used as a bleisure opportunity, according to research from  . Traditional cities for conferences, such as New York, Las Vegas, Orlando, and San Diego, are also all cities that carry appeal for tourism and vacations in addition to having more than adequate space for large business functions. Bleisure increases the appeal for companies to host conferences in cities where there is a strong pull for leisure. In turn, these conferences potentially achieve greater attendance than they would before bleisure became a widespread trend in business travel. An underrated aspect of bleisure is the ability to get to know the destination outside the walls of an office building. From eating at a popular restaurant to attending a concert or sporting event, personal travel allows for multiple ways for a traveler to get to experience the feel of a city. What is the benefit of this type of experience outside of personal vacation? Getting a feel for a city that differs from one’s own can help you interact with those you are conducting your business obligations with that are from that city. It’s also nice to be able to find things to discuss with those you meet with, such as the performance of a local sports team or a particular area of the city you find interesting. Overall, bleisure travel is shown to generate more productive meetings and better performance among business travelers than regular business trips. Thinking about the scarcity of time on a business trip is a good way to conceptualize this. With personal time on the horizon, employees are motivated to make the most of their time working when on business trips. Bleisure creates a trip where instead of the fluidity of work and rest on a normal business trip, there are clear-cut lines between the parts of your trip set aside for work and for leisure. Travelers know when it is time to maximize their work efforts, and then can have a stress-free reward, fully committing to personal time instead of having to balance the two. This clearly-defined barrier between personal and professional time on a business trip will lead to a more comfortable and productive experience in terms of both business and leisure. Allowing flexible booking dates for employees via bleisure travel actually helps  . According to research at  , flights are proven to be more expensive on Sundays, Mondays, or Fridays, days that bookend the week and are most common for business travel. By allowing travelers to book their trips with flexible dates, you’re avoiding flights on the same dates that most business travelers fly, which drives up fares. In a business travel economy where so much money is wasted on employees blindly selecting flights on   without regard for price, having a system in which travelers are able to fly on less popular dates benefits a company’s travel budget. With reports (such as this one from the  ) suggesting that more and more travelers are extending their business trips for leisure, there is no stop to the bleisure phenomenon on the horizon. Bleisure is creating higher-quality business trips, boosting employee morale, and saving companies money on business travel in the process. Going forward, it’s easy to see why this trend will continue to take off in the business travel world. ', 'The way we travel is changing. We look for flights and hotels differently than we used to, we get around our destination differently than we used to, and our experiences center on priorities that we might not have had in previous, less technologically-advanced eras. So shouldn’t the way we travel for business change with the times as well? Why should your company stick to the same, antiquated corporate travel policy that has stayed in place for years? This article examines some ways the business travel industry is changing in an era of specialization, personalization, and the sharing economy.  contributes over one trillion dollars alone to the global economy, and a survey of industry professionals (from  ) suggests that this economic impact is only primed to increase in the coming years. When evaluating this industry that is still rapidly on the rise, we examined some key trends to watch out for in business travel. Here are eight of them below. The traditional mindset of the business traveler was simple. Find the flight that was at the perfect time. Locate the hotel where you’ll have your business obligations as close to the site as possible. Rent the car that your company told you to rent. At no point did this process resemble the ways in which most people try to book personal travel. With business travel being reimbursed as long as it hung closely enough to a company’s corporate policy, there was no incentive to take any time to look at options outside one’s usual booking routine. Now, with a multitude of new options for business travelers to maximize both their comfort and preferences on a trip, the booking process won’t be constrained to the traditional standards of narrow flight and hotel options. Travelers will continue to use unique booking platforms fit for flexible itineraries and mobile, on-the-go booking. Putting more thought into how and why   the flights and hotels that they do will make the business travel experience more personal and comfortable. Travel Management Companies (TMCs) have maintained a strong hold over the business travel booking market. The benefits of using a TMC for corporations include being able to set corporate rates and track adherence to company policies. However, they can also lead to inflexibility for the traveler and can sometimes hide the best times for flights or locations for hotels based on default settings. With more booking options arising (including relatively new, industry-changing services such as Skiplagged and HotelTonight), it has become easier than ever for travelers to book on the open market instead of with a TMC. The intersection of business and leisure travel also complicates the old form of booking only for your business needs through a travel management company. As companies continue to become more employee-centric and value the desires of their business travelers, these travelers will command greater customization of their itineraries in ways not all TMCs are equipped to handle. In the traditional sense, business travel has always been centered on efficiency and corporate compliance. In today’s landscape in which millennials are no longer as loyal to their companies as they once were and are often on the move in between jobs, corporate loyalty is less of a strategy that moves the needle. In order to have employees comply with traditional corporate travel policies, there must be unique benefits that are offered as incentives for the travelers themselves. Some travel platforms offer employee-focused rewards for beating a particular budget on a flight or hotel, while others offer more flexible policies for platforms where employees can book or a period of time after a trip where they can extend their stay for personal time. In order to make sure that business travel can remain an attractive bonus for employees, companies are making sure that it includes extra perks that incentivize further willingness to participate on the employee side. “Bleisure,” or a combination of “business” and “leisure,” has emerged as a popular element of business travel in recent years. Employees have begun to view business travel as a perk rather than an obligation, especially when business trips involve attractive destinations. A   from the Global Business Travel Association and Hilton published in June of 2018 found that in the past year, 37% of North American business travelers extended a business trip for leisure. 48% of Millennials that were surveyed partook in bleisure, compared to 33% of Gen-X travelers and 23% of Baby Boomers. This trend shows that the youngest generation in the workforce, Millennials, are becoming accustomed to business trips involving some form of extended period of time for leisure almost half of the time. What constitutes an extended stay? In the same report, the GBTA found that only 23% of reported bleisure travelers extended their trip for more than three days after their business expectations are complete. What does this mean for employers? Employees who are willing to go on the road to conduct business and who value the opportunities their companies give them \xa0do so. Bleisure is turning business travel into a perk rather than a responsibility, and it is benefiting both employers and employees in the process. Between weather delays, personal life interferences, and rapidly changing business interests, traveling for work is volatile by nature. To handle all of the changes that can arise from an urgent trip that can so easily be altered or derailed by a variety of factors, booking tools need well-trained and effective teams equipped to provide customer service. In the digital economy, it is easier than ever to contact support teams through  . For more complex itineraries, customer service teams will continue to be essential to help travelers meet their required business obligations. With an increase in online booking platforms, there are more customer service teams that will be competitive in offering the best support to travelers to strengthen the brand of their service or booking tool. This competition is only good for business travelers, as the overall quality of customer service is due to continue to rise and become more specialized in the coming years. Although some may have predicted that the business travel industry would shrink in size due to the rise of  , companies have continued to make sure that in-person meetings remain central to the way they conduct business. Face-to-face meetings are still driving an increase in business travel on a year-to-year basis, and statistics from   show that companies still find in-person meetings essential to business and irreplaceable by video calls. The priorities of the big players in business travel- consulting firms, public relations professionals, and accounting firms, to name a few, will continue to drive the trends in the industry. If they are still deeming in-person meetings to be highly prioritized, then business travel will remain a thriving industry. A traditional incentive for business travelers is the loyalty points they are able to accrue through taking the same airline or staying in the same family of hotels repeatedly over the course of multiple trips. While this type of thinking can be an inefficient use of company money because it boxes travelers into opting for a certain airline or hotel that could be much more expensive than other feasible options, it does reward the employee for traveling for business by allowing them the opportunity to earn points for personal use. Loyalty points were systems put in place essentially for business travelers that spend so much time on the road. These programs from airlines and hotels are tailored exactly to the needs and wants of travelers, and it’s natural that they will continue to be popular options for many travelers who value their time away from home as a tradeoff for being able to spend points they earn on personal rewards. Expect loyalty rewards programs \xa0to remain popular for travelers that have already built up a sizable amount of points and do not view giving up their program participation for greater flexibility in their travel. As the sharing economy continues to increase steadily (with over 77 million users this year alone, according to  ), business travelers will continue to be counted among the many people engaging in ridesharing and home sharing on their trips. When traveling to a large conference in an expensive city like New York or San Francisco, renting out a condo for multiple travelers makes much more economic sense than overpaying for multiple hotel rooms that marked up for the conference. Similar principles apply to ridesharing, as having to rent a car and drive around to different business destinations on a trip may cause more pain (and expense) than is needed. The sharing economy is invading our personal lives as well, and as it continues to gain more traction in terms of everyday use, it will also become a more normalized thought for business travelers to use on their trips. Not to mention the fact that renting a home in a less crowded area could appeal to the sensibilities of some business travelers more than staying in a small hotel room in the middle of the city for the same price. The sharing economy makes sense both economically and in terms of allowing business travelers to have a bit more personal preference as to how they’d like to spend their trips. These business travel trends signal an industry adapting to travelers wanting more personalization and customizability in their business trips, lending to more overall comfortable experiences on the road. While many thought that video conferencing software and other advances in technology would diminish the scope of the business travel, technological advancements have only grown the industry and improved the quality of business trips for travelers. ', 'We’ve all been there before.\xa0 You leave home, get well on our way to your destination, and realize you forgot a crucial thing on your packing list.

You’ll want to bring headphones and any other forms of entertainment, including books or magazines, for your travel time and downtime on the trip. In addition to bringing some snacks for your business obligations, you should also bring backup food for time outside the office, as you may find yourself caught in a flight delay or unknown area while hungry. Of course, remembering your wallet, keys, and phone may sound intuitive, but it’s always best to include them on a checklist to make sure than you have them with you when you leave for your trip.

'], 13: ["Sales is one of the most stressful professions out there.\xa0 You’re on the front line every day dealing with customer issues, pitching products, negotiating, presenting and submitting proposals – all while balancing the worries, objections, concerns and needs of your customers, colleagues, sales managers, and other stakeholders. It’s a very unique job with unique stressors. Yet, the sales profession is often overlooked when it comes to recognizing the stress and   on salespeople's lives. But it’s not all bad news. Stress in sales can actually be a useful tool: it can give you the adrenaline to deliver an amazing presentation to customers, or the confidence to go out into a room full of prospects and network. However, sometimes the stress can get too much. And that’s when you need some tools to help you effectively manage that stress so that you can be free to succeed in your sales role, without being hindered by sales anxiety.\xa0 In this article, we take a look at why sales is one of the most stressful industries to work in, and what you can do as a salesperson to reduce your stress and anxiety whilst continuing to succeed in your sales job. First, let's think a little bit about what actually causes sales stress and anxiety. More importantly, what we can do to reduce these levels of stress and bring about healthier ways of working? We’re going to look at several reasons why the sales profession is particularly stressful and give you some hints and tips about how to more effectively manage that stress. Salespeople are expected to be available for their customers 24/7, and this can create an immense feeling of stress and anxiety. It’s like ‘ ’ multiplied by ten! Not only do you feel like you have to show up for your colleagues and managers, you also have to look like you’re working constantly for your customers, too. This feeling of being always on doesn’t give your mind, or your body, the opportunity to relax and recharge from a busy, stressful day. And this constant stress can impact on your ability to do your job well, as  found that 38% of salespeople reported that stress had sometimes hindered their sales performance. Clearly, if being constantly available is affecting your ability to do your job effectively, then it’s not doing your customers any favors. Salespeople, in particular, feel they have to give an impression that they are always succeeding and  , even when they aren’t. This disconnect between how a salesperson may actually be feeling and the image they think they have to present to customers, colleagues and managers, can be a huge source of stress and anxiety. Because of the nature of their work, salespeople often feel that they can’t be honest about experiencing a particularly bad month or quarter, which may stop many people from reaching out to managers and teammates for support. Showing vulnerability in sales can be something that many account managers and business development reps may feel wary of doing, but it’s sometimes the only way to open up a wider conversation about work-related stress and anxiety. Sales is all about…sales! But when the majority of your ‘worth’ at work is calculated based on last quarter’s revenue-to-quota performance, it can feel like you’re on a treadmill to constantly perform. Every quarter is important, and every quarter the quota increases, but you still have the same amount of time in a day to do your job. To continue being successful, month after month, salespeople need to be consistently developing new leads for the next period, while still closing sales opportunities that are happening right now. It’s a fine balancing act between short term and long term goals, so having a plan in place for how you will develop new opportunities and manage existing deals is critical to maintaining a healthy sales pipeline. Plus, using things like  can help you manage your day to day sales workload. Feeling like you’re only as good as your sales results can be particularly damaging to a salesperson’s self-worth, so always remember that it’s just a number – it’s not always a reflection on how well you do your job. So, now we’ve looked at some of the causes of sales stress and anxiety, we’re going to talk about some of the ways in which you can reduce your stress when working in sales. The good news is there are lots of ways to do it – and here we’ve highlighted seven simple options to get started better managing your work-related stress. Look at which particular tasks, activities or situations create the most stress for you in your day to day sales job and list out why these particular activities trigger stress for you. Is it because you aren’t comfortable with public speaking? Or, do you avoid cold calling at every opportunity? For each activity, assign a ‘stress score’ to it, based on a scale of one to ten. For example, you could score an activity that really causes you huge amounts of anxiety a ‘ten’, and give a ‘one’ for an activity that is slightly worrying, but still manageable. Once you have each of your activities’ stress scores, think about what you could do to try to reduce the level of stress you feel about each task, by either putting a set time into your diary where you have to complete the exercise (such as ‘every morning, I’ll do ten cold calls and get them out of the way first thing so that I can be less stressed throughout my day’) or investigate potential training courses to help you feel more confident about particularly stressful activities. If you’re feeling stress in your sales role, then it’s likely your teammates are stressed too. Don’t be shy to open up the conversation with colleagues, as it could probably really help out another colleague who has been struggling with an issue and has been too anxious to voice it themselves. Maybe try asking your employers to create a regular space in the diary where you and your colleagues can openly discuss what’s bothering you the most in a safe, non-judgemental and supportive environment. More employers than ever are recognising the need to support their employees’ wellbeing and mental health, so investigate what your employer offers to support staff with managing stress and anxiety at work. One problem with the always-on culture of sales is that you  . Scrimping on sleep only works for so long. Eventually, you’ll experience burnout, so think about what you can do to keep work at work. Do you need to impose a curfew for your cellphone so that you aren’t tempted to check emails from customers after 8 p.m.? Do you need to have a frank conversation with clients to impose polite, yet firm, boundaries when it comes to expectations about response times to their calls and requests? We often worry that because a client has emailed us they will be expecting an immediate response, but if they have been given clear   or even informal commitments as to when they can expect a reply, many clients are happy to wait for a response. Where clients are unhappy about response times, it’s usually because a conversation hasn’t taken place early on in the relationship about communication expectations. More often than not, that really important email that you absolutely have to respond to right now  . Rejection in sales feels incredibly personal. But here’s the thing, it rarely ever is personal. A rejection from a client is a great opportunity to go back to would-be customers to find out why they didn’t choose you. In the majority of cases, the reasons will be around budget, product or business value alignment between their company and yours. A deal loss review is a really good exercise to get into doing regularly, not only for your business but to give you some distance from a failed deal to see that losing the sale wasn’t down to you personally. Salespeople are notorious for working around the clock and checking in with customers on the weekend. However, we can’t work at our best when we’re burnt out – so it’s important to take regular breaks to recharge; even a quick walk outside of the office or eating lunch away from your desk can make all the difference. Many companies are now also offering well-being services to their staff in the office, such as meditation and lunchtime yoga, so investigate what services are available to you and try to incorporate these into your daily routine. If you can’t find the time to have a proper break away from your desk, even just five minutes of deep breathing and meditation at your desk can help if you feel stress building up. Try and find hobbies, activities and interests that can help you to unwind from work and take your mind off any stress originating from your sales job. We often think we don’t have the time for hobbies, yet, in fact, it’s just that we aren’t prioritizing our time effectively and we’re giving our job too much of our time in a day. It’s just as important to find some hobbies that calm and recharge you to ensure you’re feeling reinvigorated for the next day at work. Perhaps a new hobby could even help you in your sales role. For example, you could join an amateur dramatics or improv group which could help you to gain more confidence when presenting to customers. Or, a creative writing class could support you in writing more compelling customer proposals. When things get too much, it’s important to recognise the signals and take proper time off. It’s better to have a few days off instead of burning out completely and feeling like you can’t return to your job at all. Self-care in sales is critical, but just as important is being able to recognise the signals that you’re getting stressed. Could it be that you’ve been skipping lunches a few days in a row to work more, or perhaps you’ve had a particularly gruelling few weeks with early starts and particularly late nights? If you feel like work is having an impact on your mental health, then it’s important to check in and ask yourself whether you can carry on, or whether it would be healthier and more sensible to take a day off to get refreshed and re-energized. It’s unlikely you’re going to be able to eliminate all sales stress completely – after all, one of the things that drives a lot of salespeople to succeed is the ability to run on a degree of adrenaline and pressure, but there are ways to manage your stress if you feel that pressure tipping into being a problem. It’s about taking the time to recharge when things feel like they are getting on top of you, and recognizing what your stress triggers are so that you can catch them early on before they become a problem. Hopefully, this article has given you a few ideas about how to manage day to day stress in your sales role, but remember, if what you’re feeling is becoming unmanageable, it’s recommended that you speak to your general practitioner or doctor for professional advice and guidance. ", 'At the start of a new day, week, month, or year, it’s always nice to look forward and set expectations for yourself.\xa0 Whether it be a set number of books you want to read or recipes you want to master, setting goals is an integral part of any journey. The same goes for your professional life. If work-based goals didn’t exist, there would be a lot of unclear agendas, wasted time, and unfulfilling days.\xa0 For sales teams, the stakes are high. Assuming the role of revenue generator for a business is nothing to be taken lightly. Whether or not a sales team is successful will ultimately affect the rest of the organization. A good quarter can offer room for growth, and a bad one can hold the business back in future endeavors.\xa0 Safe to say, it’s best to start off a new stretch of business activity with some ambitious, realistic, and thoughtfully-set sales goals.\xa0 You can dream of selling more or selling faster all you want, but without a well-articulated sales goal to back it up, you’ll lack the ability to envision the path it takes to achieve it. Those ideas can most certainly act as the root of your sales goals, but there are some specific steps you’ll need to take to ensure success. A business can’t succeed without ambition. However, the idea of shooting for the moon can result in getting carried away. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t set challenging goals. By all means, aim high. But first, you need to define what “realistic” means in the realm of your goal-setting.\xa0 Determining what’s realistic to expect of your sales org requires looking at a few things. The first is past data. Analyze how your sales department has performed in the past by looking at   like revenue, profit margins, and sales funnel conversion rates. While you shouldn’t count out seeing improvements in those metrics, your business isn’t going to change overnight, so past performance will offer a good starting point.\xa0 Next, take a look at growth rates. Choosing a consistent time period to measure here is crucial. If you’re setting sales goals for a new month, look at month over month growth. The same goes for quarters, years, etc. Incorporate average growth rates with your past sales data to generate ideas of what’s attainable and what’s entirely out of reach. Remember, there’s a difference between challenging goals and unrealistic goals.\xa0 Finally, take a look at your sales team and assess their skills and potential. Determine if the goals you have in mind are realistic for that specific group. If you have a lot of new sales reps to onboard, you might want to go easy on goals until they’re fully ramped. On the other hand, if you have a department full of strong sales professionals ready to contribute, you’ll want to incorporate that into your objectives.\xa0 Now it’s time to set the goals. Depending on your business model, you can do this on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. However, keep in mind that while long term goals are important, it’s also beneficial to offer small and more frequent wins for sales teams.\xa0 Take seasonality into account. If your business has a slow or busy season, reflect the usual impact on your sales goals.\xa0 An important thing to keep in mind is the cost of keeping your business alive. Salaries, production costs, marketing expenses, and general overhead all add up, and your revenue is going to have to cover that and then some.\xa0 While the thoughts of increasing revenue or reducing sales cycle length are nice, they aren’t solid business goals. They’re just ideas. A proper sales goal needs to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound (SMART).\xa0 Let’s look at an example.\xa0 Let’s generate more revenue.\xa0 By the end of the second quarter, we will increase annual recurring revenue by 3% by reevaluating our customer retention strategy.\xa0 While the overall goals of any sales team usually revolve around money, the chosen angle will depend on the focus of the organization for that time period. This might come in the form of an emphasis on lowering churn rates, decreasing cost of goods sold, and so on. These will be reflected in your sales goals. Newly structured sales goals must be accompanied with a new strategy. You can’t achieve a recent objective without changing something about your approach. Take a look at each new sales goal and identify actionable items your team can implement to help achieve it. Make sure you have a defined set of sales metrics that will reflect your progress, success, or failure(s) along the way. Once you’ve determined what you need to do to accomplish the sales goals ahead of you, evaluate your sales strategy to see what’s working, what’s not, and anything that can be further optimized.\xa0 With answers to those questions, you’ll have a set stack of smaller goals to accomplish that will make progress towards your bigger goals. These more frequent wins will motivate sales reps to work towards long-term objectives.\xa0 Like with any new business initiative, you’ll want to track your progress along the way. Sales goals should include benchmarks and milestones so growth can be measured periodically. This will help point out if you are likely to hit sales goals or not, which might call for another round of strategizing.\xa0 With a set of sales metrics to track each goal, use real-time data and insights to carefully monitor and evaluate progress. Make sure all team members are on the same page with what’s being tracked and why. Use that data in strategy sessions to make even more improvements throughout the time period you’re tracking.\xa0 At the end of the month, quarter, or year, calculate final metrics and determine if you hit your sales goals. Hold on to that data as it will come in handy when you have to plan for future time periods.\xa0 Your sales goals will adapt to reflect the changing focuses of your business. However, there are a few common sales goal examples that will be recurring themes in your strategy. Even if they aren’t a current focus, the following eight sales goals will likely always be tracked, measured, and highly valued within your business. Increased revenue streams, whether they be monthly or annually, are always going to be a key performance indicator for your sales team. Revenue goals will be set for the entire team, but can also be done on an individual basis with sales quotas as well.\xa0 Revenue is the oil that keeps your business machine running. To succeed, you need to ensure profitability and continuous growth through revenue streams. Because of its influence, your revenue goal will likely be reflected in the rest of your sales goals. If you aren’t hitting revenue goals, you likely aren’t hitting others.\xa0 To increase monthly recurring revenue by 2% year over year. Revenue is arguably your most important sales goal for any month, quarter, or year. Stressing its weight on the success of the business is important, but you don’t want to overwhelm the sales team too much. A good way to avoid this is pairing annual goals with sales activity goals that are achievable for reps. For example, you might set individual goals for sales calls made, emails sent, and meetings scheduled. When doing this, make sure to take your typical conversion rate into account so these activities metrics can support the revenue goal.\xa0 The only way to keep your company afloat is through loyal customers, and if they churn, you’ll sink.   refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with your company. Because you need customers to survive, you want your churn rate to be as low as possible.\xa0 If your company has a subscription-based revenue model, keeping churn rate at bay can make or break your business. You will eventually start to rely on that recurring revenue and might even incorporate it into your sales forecasts. If you lose out on that income you counted on, you could run into trouble.\xa0 Solid customer relationships can be incredibly valuable to your business. Not only does it create a reliable stream of income, but it also relieves the pressure you might feel to generate new business. After all, acquiring a new customer can cost   than retaining an existing one.\xa0 To reduce monthly customer churn to less than 2%. Customers churn for a variety of reasons. Some are no longer getting value from your business’ offerings, and others might have just forgotten that their subscription ended or payment method expired. Whatever the case may be, it’s up to your sales team to keep this from happening.\xa0 Your sales reps aren’t just responsible for closing deals, but also establishing mutually beneficial relationships with customers. Relationships require communication, and even after a sale is made, these conversations should not end. Your customers’ needs will change as their business evolves, and reps need to understand how to meet these expectations.\xa0 Another way you can keep customers from churning is determining the point of churn and getting critical with the actions you’re taking at that point. Evaluate if there’s anything you’re doing or not doing that could help reduce churn rate.\xa0 Your company’s profit margin refers to the income leftover after the expense of selling is taken into account. Essentially, increasing your profit margin is boosting the amount of money you get to keep after paying off expenses.\xa0 The purpose of increasing profit margins is to create more room for your business to grow and expand. Selling more units is always valuable, but if the cost of making that happen cancels out the revenue, was it really worth it? You need enough revenue to cover those costs, and would benefit from more to hire more personnel, offer career development options for employees, and expand to new markets.\xa0 To increase profit margins year over year by 5%. Your team can achieve an increase in profit margins in a variety of ways. One of these ways being to simply sell more units, which will result in more revenue.\xa0 Selling more units can come as a result of more sales activity, such as cold calls, cold emails, and meetings with prospective customers. There are only so many hours in a work day, and adding more expectations to an already full day is a recipe for burnout.\xa0 The best way to go about this is to incorporate technology that takes care of the menial tasks a sales rep is responsible for. There are a plethora of   that can do this for your business.\xa0 Another approach for increasing profit margins is to rethink your pricing strategy. If you’re selling an acceptable amount of units, but the cost of selling continuously outweighs generated revenue, it’s possible that you aren’t charging enough for your solution.\xa0 Customer lifetime value (CLV) refers to the potential value that a client can offer throughout their entire relationship with your business. This is an important metric for businesses where salespeople handle an account for the duration of your business with them.\xa0 Again, generating revenue from existing customers is a lot cheaper than acquiring new ones, so CLV should be a high priority. Focusing on your current relationships will not only result in a positive experience for customers, but it can also lead to lower selling expenses. Wouldn’t you rather strengthen the connection with someone you already know than market to a stranger? To increase customer lifetime value by 10% year over year. The first thing you need to do to achieve a higher CLV is get to know your customers. Conduct regular research about what’s going on with their business, and identify any pain points. Match those needs to a benefit your solution can offer. Businesses change, so this is necessary even after the initial discovery.\xa0 Throughout your interactions with their business, make sure you’re tracking everything in a   to stay up to date on their data, preferences, and expectations.\xa0 Showing you truly understand your customers will establish trust and help you sell to them better. Once that baseline is established, find ways to upsell (getting customers to upgrade their current plan) and cross-sell (getting customers to also invest in another solution you or a partner offers). Don’t be sneaky about it, and only ever offer it if you think their business could benefit from it.\xa0 You can’t have a successful sales cycle if it doesn’t start strong. And the best way to make sure your   is equipped for wins is with qualified leads. A qualified lead is a prospect who has been identified as worthy of pursuing because they fit the criteria of your target persona. After initial discovery, a qualified lead is someone who has the budget, authority, need, and time to buy your solution.\xa0 Not all leads are going to end up buying your solution. Some will fall out along the way, and that’s perfectly normal. However, you need to make sure you’re fueling your pipeline with   leads, not just anyone that can help you hit an activity metric.\xa0 To increase the number of qualified leads entering the sales funnel by 12% year over year. Finding more qualified leads is a question of your   and qualification process.\xa0 Start by looking at where you find your prospects. Hint: this should be the same place you discovered people who converted into customers. Looking at past data, focus on acquisition channels that you’ve seen success with in the past. Do some initial research to determine if this person is worth pursuing.\xa0 Then, take a look at your qualification process. Are you asking the right questions about the prospect’s budget, authority, need, and time to buy? Be critical.   to not only capture leads, but score them based on their likeliness to buy. This will help you prioritize your time to focus on more promising accounts.\xa0 Stress the importance of quality of leads over quantity. It’s much more beneficial to have a pipeline full of a smaller amount of qualified leads than one with a large number of prospects that’ll end up being dead leads.\xa0 Your win rate refers to the amount of deals you close. The higher your win rate, the better it is for your bottom line. This one is tough, because you can have a killer sales process and still not end up closing the deal due to external factors out of your control. However, it’s still important to focus on when creating, executing, and optimizing a sales strategy.\xa0 The cool thing about win rates is that they can vary depending on the expertise of a rep, opportunities available in a sales territory, and the particular solution being sold. Tailoring win rate goals to these categories is a great way to monitor progress. And while prospects can exit your sales funnel at any time without explanation, having a designated win rate can alert you when and where that tends to happen, allowing you to reevaluate your approach.\xa0 To increase win rates by 5% year over year. Obtaining and sustaining a high win rate requires taking a deep look at each stage in your sales process, funnel, and buyer journey. Certain stages might be more successful than others. For example, your sales team might do perfectly fine in converting leads to opportunities, but that might not be the case when converting those opportunities into customers. Discovering this might require establishing win rates for each stage of the sales funnel.\xa0 Increasing win rates can also happen as a result of sales coaching. Identify weaknesses in each of your sales reps and find a professional development method to enhance their skills in that area. This might include training on cold calling or value demonstrations.\xa0 Overall, you can increase your win rates by taking a good look at your sales process, aligning it with the buyer journey, and boosting your sales professionals’ skills.\xa0 Customer acquisition cost (CAC) refers to the amount of money it costs to obtain a new customer. To see a profit, your customer lifetime value must exceed your CAC. If this isn’t the case, you either need to find a more efficient way to sell or find a price point that will result in a profit.\xa0 While focusing on existing relationships is cheaper, getting new business is important, too. Setting a goal to reduce CAC can push sales reps and marketers to be more intentional with the way they go about acquiring new customers.\xa0 To reduce customer acquisition cost by 3% month over month. Decreasing the money you spend marketing and selling to customers requires examining your processes and seeing where you spend the most money. Yes, you have to spend money to make money, but this is more a question of determining if that spend is worth it. Are the areas where you spend the most money while selling producing results? Are you targeting the right audience with your marketing tools? Are the customers you’re acquiring offering substantial customer lifetime value? You also need to think about tools that can make your sales strategy more efficient.   is crucial in reducing the time it takes to sell, and we all know time is money. This tool provides reps with all of the resources and content they could ever need to use during the sales cycle, all in the same place.\xa0 Sales cycle length is the amount of time it takes to convert a prospect into a customer. In the SaaS industry, these cycles are complex multi-step processes that will vary depending on the product and value of the deal.\xa0 The length of your sales cycle speaks to its efficiency. Hesitation from customers can lengthen the process, but so can inaccurate targeting, poor sales pipeline management, and lack of relevant sales content.\xa0 To reduce the length of the sales cycle by 4-6% (subject to deal type). A lot of times, reducing the length of your sales cycle takes research and planning. While it might take more time in the beginning, it will save you more time later on when you’re actually interacting with customers. A good example of this is identifying the key decision-maker at the prospective company. Getting passed around to multiple   can result in losing steam, and researching to identify the key stakeholder beforehand can save loads of time.\xa0 Focusing on   and automation can reduce the amount of time to convert a customer, as it includes implementing technology at every stage of the sales process, from lead generation to tracking customer conversations to general sales engagement. There’s no point in setting a goal if you don’t plan on seeing it through. The example sales goals listed above will almost always be relevant, but that doesn’t mean they will always be your primary focus. Besides, focusing real hard on all of those at once is a recipe for burnout. To ensure they’re achieved, make sure your sales goals are specific, obtainable, and rewarding.\xa0 ', 'Sales role-playing is the number one activity new hires can do in order to be set up for selling success.\xa0 Our brains learn by doing, forming habits, and creating neural pathways from those actions. Playing out different scenarios of a sales call is the best technique new hires can use to prepare for being in the moment. So the quicker you can get them to think on their feet and create these neural pathways, the quicker their brain will start to know where to go over time and confidently run a call or demo. It also gives managers a really good opportunity to see what a rep can potentially be like in the field and help them identify where their weaknesses are. Different reps are naturally better at different parts of a sales call. Effective sales role-playing isn’t just about role playing in a group or using the hot seat technique, it’s about practicing each step or phase of a discovery or demo in order to hone and own it as a whole. Many reps are great at specific parts of a demo such as the introduction, discovery questions, handling objections, and pushing to next steps. To set your reps up for success, help them understand where they are naturally strong today and what areas they need to prop up before their first call. Sales reps skills as negotiators can only improve with constant practice. Especially if they are early in their career. Make it a habit for them to spend about an hour a week role playing these 5 scenarios to get those extra at bats. Let’s say each rep runs about five meetings in a week, that means if a rep role plays once for about 45 minutes to an hour a week (and that’s longer than a typical call), that’s one whole extra week every single month of at bats they’re getting. So over the course of their first six months, they’ll already have had seven and a half months of at bats and practice. Over the course of a year, that’s three months of extra at bats. “John Smith” running just his five appointments a week got 12 months of calls and practice, while a rep constantly role-playing technically got 15 months. In setting these expectations, not only did you set new hires up for success during the onboarding process by role-playing, but your reps are   and becoming better salespeople. In their first six weeks of boarding and beyond, reps should always be role playing these five scenarios either with another rep, a manager, in a group, or by making it a team exercise.\xa0  is the most important sales role play you can do, period. It gets new hires comfortable in always asking “next layer questions” that will have an immediate impact on the quality of their discovery process.\xa0 The first step of the discovery or any call is showing value and setting the agenda.  with their phone experience with reps, and with a Discovery being the first real connection with a prospect, it can set the tone for the rest of the  . Once a rep can smoothly set the stage for the call, discovery role-playing is really about teaching them to not just read they’re discovery questions off the list they have in front of them, but peel back what a prospect is saying and ask those next layer questions to really dig into a prospect’s needs. Asking the right questions from the beginning and peeling back challenges also sets reps up to better handle objections later in the call. For example, you’re an ag tech company talking to a vegetable greenhouse farm who is already using a ton of systems to run their business.\xa0 A good exercise for this scenario is to have one rep keep asking another rep (playing the prospect) “why” and “what challenges is that causing?” This can be a bit difficult for new reps who aren’t very familiar with your product or buyer, so providing info sheets surrounding the scenario first is best. Part of new hire trainings is really understanding your company’s different buyer personas who have different problems and pain points. Role playing from the perspective of these different persona’s will help new hires provide the right solutions and address the specific needs of each type of buyer they may encounter. Reps need to know how to speak to solutions and how your company solves problems versus just talking about the product. We must train reps early on that when doing a demo it is important to listen and hear the problem in order to provide the right solution as opposed to saying “for that problem, we have this product.” For example, you’re a real estate CRM software company and you’re talking to a national home builder. The exercise for this scenario is simple. Reps will sit or stand in a circle with one rep in the middle at random to start. How a rep stays in the circle, is when a problem is yelled out, they only talk about solutions. If they mention a feature, then the rep who tripped them up enters the circle. Also, set a time limit on how long it takes a rep to come up with an answer. This exercise plays off of problem-solution mapping. The idea is by not being able to use the product name or your company name, you’re only left with talking about how you solve problems. This puts reps in a consultative mindset and tells buyers they are focusing on their particular needs versus focused on talking about and selling a product. For example, you’re company sells automated invoice processing software that also manages time and tasks for small businesses, and you’re talking to a company whose pricing model is based on an hourly rate.\xa0 A good way to check reps and for reps to check themselves on their overuse of the product or company name is by recording their sales calls and listening back. There are a ton of   that can record sales calls to pinpoint areas of improvement. Listening to calls and providing feedback is a great way to coach new hires and increase productivity on your whole team.\xa0 The purpose of role playing rebuttals is not just to have a quick way to counter argue an objection. But to handle objections in a way that doesn’t derail the conversation. The term rebuttal by nature sounds combative but it shouldn’t be. A good technique is always teaching people how to acknowledge that prospects have an objection. And to prepare from the beginning of the conversation that they’re going to have objections. The most   reps encounter are timing, budget, and decision maker. We know this. So if a rep runs their Discovery right, they can engineer their rebuttals to where it doesn’t seem like pushback. If possible, you want to engineer the conversation to where they’re aren’t any objections. For example, one of the most common objections is timing. The key is if a rep has done their homework and if they’ve asked the right questions in the beginning, the prospect has already told them a compelling event, which allows them to come back and say: The second common objection is budget, and the best way to handle this objection is to not shy away from it. It’s ok to ask:\xa0 The third most common objection is the decision making process. In this case, it’s the same as timing and budget. A rep should have asked about this in Discovery and infer what a prospect is going to say. This sets you up for next steps and getting on the phone with that next person. A good exercise for these types of scenarios is the objection ball. Someone starts by saying a common objection, and then throws it to someone randomly and they answer with a rebuttal. Then the person who answered with the rebuttal says another objection and throws it to someone else. Driving to next steps or the next meeting is probably one of the most difficult parts of a call for new reps. You want to get them in the mindset of not just ending a demo and saying “Ok, so this is what’s going to happen next,” but driving the prospect to next steps naturally. End driving to next steps with an open question so prospects feel like they have made the decision and weren’t told what the next step is. For example: Sales role playing is just practicing before the game. If you think about any professional athlete, they never stop practicing. Baseball players hit up the batting cage; golfers go to the driving range. Business is like sports in that aspect. If you’re not practicing, it would be like studying golf or studying the mechanics of a right swing but never teaching your body and brain to perfect it. The same thing goes for salespeople and executives. Whether you’re new to the game or a company, or your a senior sales exec who’s been with the same company for 5 years, we all role play in our heads or practice our presentations before it’s time to go into the meeting. There are a lot of variables to sales calls and demos, and anytime you have a lot of variables, role-playing can help to simplify what you actually should do.\xa0 '], 50: ["There’s no doubt about it: graphic designer’s resumes can look awesome. Your graphic design resume should contain all of the basic necessities with a little extra pizazz. Let’s take a look at what some of the pros include (and feel free to jump ahead to any of the following sections using the links below).\xa0 We're going to go over how to make these all pop out a little bit so that you can stand out amongst the crowd, but before we do, I want to address something to avoid.\xa0 There's a few problems with this resume/milk carton.\xa0 The first problem: there’s a   to see here. Colors, shapes, pictures, and a three dimensional object. As a piece of art, maybe. As a resume, probably not the best idea. It’s going to take a few rotations to see information that should be much more easy to access. The colors and design are powerful, but could overshadow the important information that the applicant is providing within. Additionally, hiring managers like to keep resumes handy so that they and the interviewers have something to refer back to. Where are they going to keep a carton? This isn’t to say that your resume can’t be creative. In fact, some people have gotten really clever and still manage to keep their resume appropriate when they create an  . In this article, we’re going to hit a point in   the traditional resume and the infographic resume. And we’re going to stay far away from a milk carton. The following are all of the elements that should be in your resume, along with some ways to spice them up.\xa0 Obviously! Your name should be one of the focal points of your resume. This can be done with enlarged text, color, and borders. Often, designers include a headshot, but it’s definitely not required. It just helps the hiring manager get a better idea of who you are and makes you seem like a little more to them than just another piece of paper. This graphic artist figured out some neat ways to display headshots alongside names: This should probably go without saying, but if you want to hear back from the hiring manager, you’re going to have to give them a way to get in touch At the very least, you should be including your phone number, email, and a link to your online  . Social media platforms can (and should) be added to your portfolio. Right now, the most important thing for the hiring manager to see is that they have a way of getting back to you. Your contact information shouldn’t stray too far from your name, as those two things are naturally linked. Contact information should not draw as much attention as your name, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t draw any at all. You’ll want to make that information stand out, whether that means bolding the text or framing it in a different color. Here's a few different ways to do it:\xa0 While putting an objective is a little out of date, there’s some professionals that choose to do this so that HR can get a better understanding of what they’re looking for. Instead, we’re going to title this section “Summary” or “Profile”. The reason for this is because most hiring managers know what your objective is: to  . Instead, use this section to give a little sneak peek into your resume and cover letter by quickly going over (in about two to three sentences) the qualifications you have as a graphic designer. Think of this as something similar to your LinkedIn profile’s summary. You may want to include the amount of experience you’ve had and your interests. This section could be paired with your name and contact information, or can be a section on its own like the ones below: If you’re applying to be a graphic designer, Microsoft Word may be a good skill to have, but it probably shouldn’t be at the top of your list.   are probably a little different than the skills of a salesperson. List the skills that make you unique as a graphic designer and those that would make you particularly attractive for the position you’re applying to. In terms of formatting, graphic designers have the privilege of being a little more visual than anybody else in their resumes. If you’re an expert in Adobe Creative Suite but only know a little HTML, there’s an abundance of different ways to let the hiring manager know. Don’t want to get that fancy? You don’t have to display it this way at all! Simple lists still work, but as a graphic designer this is an opportunity to  display your skills, so keep that in mind. These graphics aren’t just cool, they also let the hiring manager know  how comfortable you are in each of your skills. This is one of the most important parts of your resume. It tells employers where you’ve been and what you’ve done so far. As a graphic designer, you may already have some experience under your belt: freelance gigs, internships, other full-time graphic design jobs, etc. Include any jobs that would be relevant to the one you’re applying for. Under each job, you’ll want to include the dates you worked there, the name of the company you worked for, as well as the responsibilities you had while you were there. Did you make a sweet  ? Make sure it's reflected on your resume. When listing out your work history, reverse-chronological order is your best bet. By putting your most recent experience at the top, you’ll be letting the hiring manager know what your capabilities are to date, right off the bat. The classic work-experience paradox: every job requests you have ‘X’ amount of years of experience in the industry. Where are you supposed to get that experience if   requires it? While it may be hard for an aspiring journalist or marketer to find experience, there’s tons of opportunities for a graphic designer to get experience without even having to leave the couch. Look up some practice briefs or contests online\xa0and participate in them. You can even step out and offer to design a logo for a local business or a club at school. These can all be displayed in your portfolio and alluded to in your resume as freelance projects. It’s important to include your education experience on your resume. It doesn’t matter if your degree was in graphic design or in engineering. It doesn’t even matter if you have a degree. Any and all education should be included. This is to show employers that you meet their minimum education requirements for the position. If you were on the executive board of a graphic design club or helped design a university department’s website, you should probably include that as well. Anyone can say they know a program or a technique inside and out, but a great way to prove that to a hiring manager is with a certification. Graphic designers can show off their creative skills in a portfolio all they want, but to be certified in a type of\xa0design software can really put you ahead of the pack. It proves that you not only have the creative skills to apply within the program, but you understand the software’s technicalities. TIP: Not sure which   to master first? When including certifications in your resume, make sure you include the year you earned them. Because software and programs are constantly updating, certifications are too. Some only last a few years before you have to take the test all over again. Everything listed should be up to date. Now that we’ve gotten a chance to go over all of the important elements of a resume and how professionals often display them, it’s important to see what it looks like when everything is put together. This resume embodies exactly what we’ve already\xa0discussed above. Axel Martian provides the hiring manager with a resume that calls attention to his name. He has a summary next to his headshot and provides the necessary contact information. His also includes his education and provides a reverse-chronological listing of his experiences. Finally, he makes the viewer aware of his skills in a unique and elegant way. This example uses color and shapes, but not to the point where it is distracting for the viewer. Instead, the colors and shapes compliment the overall feel of the resume and make it pleasant to look at. I could look at it all day. Here’s a resume that’s different than the first one yet still manages to check all of the same boxes. Madison George’s resume has her name in the top left corner instead of centered, but the font is still large and attention-grabbing. She includes her skills and displays their measurements with bars. She includes her profile at the top and separates it from the remainder of her resume. Her experiences are listed in reverse-chronological order, and all of her educational experiences are displayed below. At the footer, she provides her contact information and highlights it in off-white to make it stand out from the above information. This resume works with multiple colors but chooses calm shades so as not to overwhelm the viewer. She also uses little icons next to each section as a way to visually differentiate between them. I’d say this one is pretty easy on the eyes as well. Success! It’s important to balance the visual elements of your resume with the content itself. Don’t forget that a graphic designer’s resume isn’t supposed to be the Cirque Du Soleil of resumes; it’s just supposed to make you stand out and, of course, be well-designed. No need to send a milk carton. It’s all about injecting a little more personality into your resume as a designer than the average person would. Make it funky, add some color, but remember the position you’re applying for and what the hiring manager wants to see. If you’re applying to work in-house, it’s best to keep the exciting ideas to the online portfolio. If you’re applying for a company that’s a little younger, maybe an infographic resume wouldn’t be too risky. \xa0 ", 'Ah yes, the age-old question. When you’re starting to   at the beginning of your career, it may be difficult to stretch your experiences to fit a full page. On the other hand, you may be well into your career and have difficulty deciding if you should stick to the classic one-page or make the jump to a two-page resume. While everyone will have different circumstances, there is a standard rule you should try and always stick to. Crafting your resume takes time to get right and usually involves a couple of rough drafts before you are happy with the final product. Even after you land the job, you’ll need to update your resume as you make career changes and trying to squeeze your entire work history onto one page may not be feasible. Some questions can’t be answered simply. How long your resume should be is one of those questions. In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about creating, crafting, updating, and formatting your resume. Let’s get one thing out of the way: While students entering the workforce will have a one-page resume 99.9% of the time, workers far into their career may find it difficult to detail their responsibilities, past experience, and accomplishments onto one page when changing jobs. Although we’ve been told that the one-page resume is the norm, that may not be the case anymore. According to a recent   that involved close to 500 recruiters, HR professionals, and hiring managers, recruiters are 2.3X as likely to prefer two-page resumes over one-page resumes. So why the change? A big factor of recruiters accepting resumes longer than one page is the increase in activities and experience of college students and recent graduates. Today’s young adults are more likely to enter the working world with more experience than generations past. From internships to freelancing, students are encouraged and more self-motivated to build their experience to fulfill the typical 1-3 years of experience that many entry-level jobs require. On top of securing these opportunities, they’re also more likely to have online portfolios, participate in volunteer work or leadership programs, and involve themselves in campus activities to build their experience without having to fluff up their resume. As we stated before, there are exceptions to every rule. Extending your resume to two pages is acceptable when you absolutely need to communicate key achievements, experiences, projects, and other relevant information. On the other hand, filling your resume with irrelevant responsibilities and information can put your application at risk of being placed in the “no” pile. An example of someone who may need to have a two-page resume is a project manager (or most people who work in events). They are likely to have dozens of individual projects under their belt with a variety of standout accomplishments. If they decided to make a career change, the recruiter or hiring manager wouldn’t fault them for having a multiple page resume. Resume length depends on the position you’re applying for. If you’re applying for a senior manager position that requires more experience, listing your past two positions will not be enough. Alternatively, if the position you’re applying for has a requirement of three years, detailing 15+ years of experience will not make sense. In short, tailor the resume to the position and only list relevant experience. If you’re applying for a position and still want to briefly mention roles you held that may not directly correlate to the job, including a career note or an earlier experience section at the top of your resume is a good option. Including one of these gives you the ability to include experiences that are adjacent but not directly relevant to the position. The key is to keep the blurb short and sweet, excluding things like responsibilities and employment dates. There are dozens of formatting options that people use to help you fit resume restrictions. If you’re finding it difficult to fit your experiences on one page, try tweaking the font size, shortening the spacing between paragraphs, and bump out the margins. Standing out is a good thing, especially when you can’t be there when the hiring manager is taking in your entire work life in a matter of seconds. Customizing the look of your resume may not be the most important part of the job search, but it certainly can help. Take a look at a sample resume. Jamir’s original resume listed his experience but didn’t have much organization or personalization. The revamped resume is much more intriguing and will have a higher chance of catching a recruiter’s eye at first glance. Keep it short and sweet. According to a  , recruiters and employers take about 6 seconds to look over a resume and decide if the applicant is a good fit. Instead of fleshing out all of your responsibilities, keep your job summaries to a few concise bullet points. Studying the job description and qualifications is also a great way to understand exactly what they’re looking for and what you should include in your resume. If they’re looking for an event coordinator, cutting out your years as a waitress is probably a safe bet. To keep things even more condensed, use your   to list basic information like education, contact information, and personality traits that will help you succeed on the job. By doing so, you save room on your resume to list only your most relevant skills. If you can summarize your experience and accomplishments in one concise and powerful page, do it. The punchier you can make yourself sound, the better. Say you worked in sales and doubled revenue over four years. Summarizing that accomplishment in a short sentence will be impressive enough. No need to fluff it up. \xa0 ', 'Cover letters aren\'t dead, but they are evolving. When was the last time you wrote a cover letter? For many of us, it\'s been years since we dusted off our  , updated our LinkedIn, or wrote a cover letter for a new position. It wasn’t until I graduated, jobless and floundering, that I really understood the importance of cover letters. But with technology booming and most jobs being screened by  , I had to wonder whether cover letters even mattered anymore. Cover letters are tricky because there\'s no standard for how to do them correctly. What might seem fine to one HR manager could annoy another. It was, and still is, difficult for me to determine exactly how to strike a balance in my cover letter. Even know the expert opinion seems torn on whether or not cover letters are worth the time it takes to write them. It’s possible you’re in the same predicament: trying to make an impression without soiling your chances at a dream job. In this article, you’ll learn everything you need to know about how to write an effective cover letter that still reads as human. The first section of your cover letter is the header.You should format the header of your cover letter just as you\'d format a formal letter. This section isn\'t very complicated, but making sure you do it right is important. This is your first introduction to whoever is reading our cover letter, so pay close attention to it! Remember to include a professional email address, not the funny one you made in high school. If you’re currently employed, refrain from using a work email as a form of contact for this application. You could also choose to include your physical address in the header image, should you feel it provides you an advantage over other candidates. Once a hiring manager has looked over the header, they\'ll jump to your introduction next. It\'s important to make a splash in this section and catch the readers attention right away. Think of this the same way you might think of a book synapsis. You have a small window of time to pique their interest with what you say next. That all sounds pretty standard, what can you do to make all of that information  Have you ever been called the wrong name at a party? Or maybe you\'ve been talking to someone and you can tell they don\'t know your name? Hiring mangers deal with this every time they read a cover letter that starts, "Dear Sir and/or Madam..." Taking the time to find the correct contact information for the hiring manager will help you stand out more than you know. If the hiring manager’s name and title aren’t immediately clear, do some research. Go to the company’s LinkedIn profile to see who your manager might be. Look at the company’s teams page to see if they have a directory of staff. If you\'re working with a recruiter, ask them for the hiring manger\'s name.I guarantee it will make a difference for someone to see you’ve addressed them by name. This next section of your introduction is all about how you wrap yourself up in the right package.Begin making an impression this early in the letter by highlighting why you\'re the right person for the job. The point here is to state your interest and grab hold of their attention. Be sure to begin by restating the position for which you are applying. Next, briefly outline or describe an experience or achievement that makes you uniquely qualified for the open position. This paragraph should be no more than a few sentences. In the second and potentially third paragraph, you’ll go into more detail regarding why you are a good fit for the role. Remember that hiring managers are reading potentially hundreds of these letters. “I studied this subject in school” or “I have done this job for years” is not going to leave a lasting impression. Instead, express your interest in the role in a new and compelling way. Perhaps include a sentence showing you understand the the type of candidate they’re looking for. Give specific examples, and include proof if you can. Quantify everything you can with data. If you’re a salesperson, include your quarterly earnings. If you’re a writer, list some publications that have published you and include your portfolio. One easy way to do this is to look at the specific requirements or responsibilities of the role listed in the job posting. They are so clearly laid out for you and you’d be a fool not to utilize them! Hiring managers want to feel as though you’re excited for this role in particular, not just the shot at a change of pace or a higher paying salary. For this reason, you may consider including a paragraph displaying your research on the company and the reasons you believe this organization, in particular, is the right place for you. This type of paragraph shows the time you’ve spent to make your cover letter specific to the job at hand. This type of personability will have a positive effect on those reviewing your letter as they will feel like you’re specifically here for the job. One simple formula for the second paragraph is to take a bit of knowledge you have about the company, state it, and explain why it is interesting or compelling to you. Are they growing at a rapid rate? Take the opportunity to state your passion for scaling organizations and the culture changes that accompany growth. An easy way to do this is to set up Google News alerts for the company you\'re targeting to find the latest information about the company. Also, check out their social media accounts and see if they\'ve been posting about any new projects. Another tip?    and highlight your experience with those projects. Companies hire people to fill knowledge gaps and bring new expertise. If you can strike a chord with them about something they struggle with, you\'ll be sure to catch their eye. One big mistake people make is thinking their experiences are limited to their professional life. If you volunteer, have a side-hustle, or a hobby, there\'s a chance that you have related  from these experiences that you can mention. If you\'re having trouble thinking about how your experience relates to the job posting these transferable skills can help fill in the experience gaps you might have in your professional career. After the third paragraph, it’s about time to wrap up the cover letter. You’ll want to close out your cover letter with a short and concise conclusion paragraph. You don’t want to take too much time from the people with hiring powers. It’s better they feel you’ve respected their time with a cover letter of a reasonable length as opposed to rambling on. Many recommend your conclusion to have a call to action, such as meeting up for a discussion or getting their thoughts on the future of the industry. When the hiring manager is done reading your letter, what do you want their next action to be? They’re not just looking for someone who wants the role, but also for someone who can perform it well. Instead of ending the letter by begging, end it by reiterating your knowledge and making another lasting impression.It’s possible they’ll act on it, it’s possible you’ll never hear from them. Either way, you’re opening up the dialogue and expressing your interest. After this, you’ll need to more formally sign out of the letter with a sincerely, best, or kind regards before your name. Although your name is at the beginning of the letter, it’s best you include it at the end as well. The professional world has so many unwritten rules and barriers to entry that it’s easy to make a mistake in front of hiring managers without ever knowing you did anything wrong. In journalism school, I once emailed a source, only to have them email my editor and the rest of the newspaper department outlining how unprofessional it was to ask questions over email. You can bet I learned to never do that again. But you can also learn things without embarrassment, which is what I’m hoping to do for you now. Here are a few of the most common cover letter mistakes for you to review and avoid as you go after your dream job. Take the extra ten minutes and address the letter with a specific name. This personalizes the experience and makes a stronger impression. If you’re having trouble finding the name of a hiring manager and you’ve done all the research you can, feel free to write “Dear COMPANY NAME,” or “Dear TEAM NAME at COMPANY NAME.” This shows you’ve personalized it to the extent in which you are able. Instead, try and change the wording to focus more on the way you can have an impact at the company. The cover letter is partially about your achievements, but mostly it’s about what you can do for this company. Even so, be careful not to write a cover letter that simply repeats your resume or job application. A cover letter is an opportunity to self-advocate in a unique way. Try and use this space to outline experiences you’ve not yet been able to discuss. how you hated your last job For one, it’s unprofessional. And for two, you’ll look like someone who dwells on their issues as opposed to someone who is fully invested in the job at hand. When hiring, managers are asking themselves, “Will I enjoy working with this person?” You want to give them every reason to answer with a resounding yes. While your intention is to land the job, it’s important to remember that hiring managers don’t owe you anything. Don\'t fall into the trap of begging or obsessing over why this is your dream company and you would be devastated if you didn\'t get the job. It might come off like you\'re willing to take any job, which could hurt your in the long run. Stay cool, calm, and confident. Hiring managers read a lot of the same sentiments over and over. The least you can do is try and think of unique ways to discuss your skills and experience. Remember, when it comes to getting a job, you want to put your best foot forward. It wouldn\'t be enough to just preach about the best practices for writing a cover letter without asking the experts what they think. We took to LinkedIn and asked industry experts what their opinions on cover letters are, the best examples they\'ve seen, and how you can optimize your cover letter for success. Here are some of the highlights: Many of our career experts were quick to point out that your cover letter is the perfect chance to explain a non-linear resume, absence in work, or  . Another common piece of advice we saw was recruiters and career experts advising against half-baked cover letters. Several of our experts expressed frustration at reading an incredible cover letter, only to be let down by a subpar resume attached to it. As some experts pointed out, most recruiters use applicant tracking systems to  and extract the important information to determine if you\'re qualified. That said, a cover letter can have a big impact if you make it far enough in the recruiting process to have it read by a hiring manager. As you can see above, even the experts disagree about the importance of a cover letter. The truth is that sometimes your hard work isn\'t rewarded. You might work tirelessly to write the perfect cover letter, only to have it tossed to the side. While there\'s nothing you can do to control what happens with your cover letter, you can control the amount of effort and time you put into a cover letter.Who knows? The cover letter you spend lovingly crafting might be the thing that sets you apart for your dream job. That\'s time worth investing. \xa0 '], 38: ['Today \xa0 ', '    ', '\xa0 '], 7: ["Over four million blog posts are published on the internet each day.

Even if you’re writing the most awe-inspiring blogs, very few people are going to naturally link to you. This is why marketers are now experimenting with entirely new methods to attract attention. While some work, others don’t. Some skyrocket the number of links to your content, others still don’t work. Cue the Moving Man method. Nobody wants broken links on their site. They only make for poor user experience. That’s exactly what you’re trying to benefit from here. And that’s exactly what the Moving Man method helps you with. The name isn’t that self-explanatory, so let’s talk it out. A short description would be link building on steroids. You might think we’re kidding, but really that’s what this method is.\xa0 It seems simple enough, and honestly, it really is. The entire method is super scalable – you just need a process in place. Here’s everything you will need to know about the Moving Man method, from its background down to how you can execute it smoothly for promising results.  was first started by Brian Dean of Backlinko. He managed to land several links to high authority sites - something which would’ve been impossible without this method. Since his success, the Moving Man method has gained more traction and is now amongst one of the surest ways for link building. It revolves around broken link building, which you might have figured out by now. Although the tactic is just three easy steps, it helps to have a comprehensive guide along the way. A question many have asked. The answer is pretty intuitive. If you’re telling people about the broken links on their site, chances are that they’ll happily replace them with working ones. About now, you could be thinking, “The site can just find and replace the broken links on their own”. But realistically, no webmaster constantly checks every external link on their website to find and fix any broken ones. The method also works because you don’t have to create content from scratch. As we will soon see below, you can easily find out what the original linked content was. All you have to do is update or recreate the content and you’re good to go, so you get to save a lot of time. Here’s a quick look at all the steps involved in the Moving Man method before we dive deeper into each of them.\xa0 So you know what the whole method is. But how do you even find relevant broken links in the first place? It seems like looking for a needle in a haystack at this point. Once you get to it, you’ll learn that it’s easier than you thought. We’re looking for these particular instances because they all lead to one thing of our interest: broken links. Another way of finding broken links is to start with a few simple Google searches. Remember that the keywords should be very niche-specific so your results are entirely relevant to your industry. Let’s look at an example. Back in 2013, Moz (as we know it today) changed its name from SEOMoz to Moz. This also means that they moved their website from SEOmoz.org to Moz.com. Hence, all the links to SEOMoz were broken. Do you see where we’re going with this? If you find something like this, it means you just hit the backlink jackpot. If the site has a good domain authority, that means hundreds of people link to the content. Since all those links are now broken, you can easily jump in and pitch your content.\xa0 Where now there are broken links, once there was valuable content. But the content isn’t there anymore since the link’s broken. So what are you going to recreate and pitch to people for links? This step is about answering that question. There are free sites that take you way back to show you what the broken page used to look like. The most commonly used tool is the  . Just plug in the URL to the broken page, and you’ll know what was there in the past. That’s the content you have to improve, update, and recreate. Now you know of a site that recently changed its name or a piece of content that’s no longer there, the next step is to figure out how many sites are linking to it. Those are the sites you’re going to reach out to. A simple way of doing this is grabbing the outdated and broken URL and putting it into any backlink checking tool of your choice. There are plenty of free ones that give you a list of all the sites that point to the broken content. That list makes your life so much easier. It shortlists all your link prospects for you. You can reach out to all those prospects and suggest that they replace the broken link with your new resource. Chances are if you’re doing this for a whole list of potentials, you’re sure to land a decent amount of links. You have all the information you need by now. So it’s time to put your head down and get to improving the outdated content. There are several ways you can do that. Apart from all these, stick to “How-to” and “Why” blog posts. These formats are known to generate more links than others according to a study by  . Just because you’re pointing out the broken link to someone doesn’t mean they’re going to replace it with your link unless your content is worth it. So don’t think you’ve already got the links in the bag. You still have to create content that’s worth linking to. You’ve done all the hard work – it’s time to reap the rewards. The last step is to reach out to all the people from the list in step three. Don’t ask them for a link from the get-go. That just seems too pushy. Start off by telling them about the broken link on their site. Then gently mention how you have a relevant post they could link to instead if they deem fit. People are going to be more than happy to link to your content because, by emailing them, you’re already adding value to their site twice. The first time is when you point out the broken link that is destroying their user experience. The second time is when you let them know of another link-worthy piece of content to make their job much easier.\xa0It’s best to have an email template made for such emails.\xa0 Remember to personalize this template a bit for each person you send it to. For example, don’t start an email with the generic “Dear Editor". Instead, do your research to find the actual name of the person you’re emailing. It may seem like a small thing. But it’s the small things that really set you apart from everyone else fighting for backlinks too. Getting quality links AND creating amazing content is hard. The Moving Man method makes both these things easier. It cuts down your work for you. You aren’t creating content from point zero anymore, and have a baseline to build up from. Once you get the hang of the method, you’ll be able to gain more and more links along the way. You’re going to get positive results from the start. That\'s because you’re doing someone a favor by giving them helpful information to improve the quality of their site. So chances are, they’re going to be more inclined to return the favor. So go ahead – it’s time to let those links roll in.\xa0 ', 'Blogs have been popular since the earliest days of modern internet usage. However, the blogs of yore are considerably different than the types of blogs we see now.\xa0Professionals have a plethora of  \xa0options for blog hosting tailored to the type of content they post. While some blog sites are built for artists and creatives and are more akin to portfolios, others are more well suited for those posting written content. All these options have left LiveJournal and Blogger in the dust. Blogs are an excellent way to establish an internet presence and position oneself as a   in their given area of expertise. A blog can act as an outlet through which professionals can write about issues or subjects they might not get to touch on in a formal setting. Personal blogs provide the freedom to write and publish thoughts without the time or priority constraints that come with work. , but where does someone get started? How do you figure out what to blog about? There is a sea of web content management and website builder options available to complement or optimize blogging sites, so even figuring out where to host a blog is a beast in itself. Here we’ll break down the necessary steps to start a blog. Starting a blog may sound daunting, but since the popularization of the medium, the process has been optimized to a science. Here we’ll break down the necessary steps to start a blog: These steps are the backbone to getting your blog up and running. There will be tips toward the end concerning content posting, but for right now we’re just going to focus on   and ready for use. While this seems like a simple step, deciding on the focus and direction of your blog is actually critical to its success. The goal of most blog owners is to gain a following of readers or fans. Unless you’re already famous, it may be difficult to develop a following if your blog doesn’t consistently cover one or a couple of topics. For example, say you begin watching a cooking show. If some of the episodes are about fashion or gardening, it may throw off viewers who tuned in expecting to learn about how to grill or properly cut vegetables. Even if those unrelated pieces were good, they weren’t what viewers were looking for to begin with. As a result, they may lose interest and move on to another show without waiting to see if the show would eventually address how to perfectly grill a peach. Sticking with one topic isn’t as hard as it sounds when the subject matter is broad. Hosting a generalized cooking show is going to be a lot easier than one that specifically presents obscure pufferfish recipes.\xa0 It is worth mentioning that blogs covering niche topics do exist and can be very successful. Understanding your desired audience is the most important consideration in this regard. Asking yourself the above questions can help frame your blog and guide the process to the best final product. On the other hand, many people start blogs as a form of journaling, and viewership isn’t as (or at all) important to them. If this is the case for you, feel free to ignore this section and move onto naming your blog. Like the previous step, this one is deceptive in the gravity of its importance. On the obvious front, the title of your blog will play a significant factor in pulling in viewers. A vague blog title isn’t going to tell a reader a lot about what they can expect. Similarly, a generic title won’t entice viewers or compel them to check out your content. Less obvious is the effect a blog title has on search engine optimization (SEO). SEO affects how your blog or website ranks in search engines, directly impacting how visible your content will be when viewers search for related terms. If you’re aiming for broad viewership, taking SEO into consideration is critical, especially once you begin to create content. The point of posting content is for it to be seen, and the first step to that is making sure content can be found easily. A blog title should be related to the content in question to clearly convey the subject matter to readers and to rank well for SEO purposes. The goal is to strike a balance between these two aspects. For example, it will be easier to find a cooking blog titled “Jazmine’s Kitchen” versus one called “Jazmine’s Corner” since the word “kitchen” is more associated with recipes and food than “corner” is. Once you have decided on a name, you can begin filing for ownership and setting up your site through a   provider. The good news is that there are countless blogging platforms and website builder software options from which you can choose when deciding which you like best. The bad news is that there truly are   platforms to choose from, and narrowing them down becomes a process in of itself. Don’t worry, though. Your blogging predecessors have walked this road long before you, which has resulted in plenty of debate and resources that helpfully weigh the benefits of the   with the drawbacks of each platform. The main distinction between platforms are those that are   and  . These are typically established websites that allow you to make a blog without cost. However, you usually won’t have the option to create a custom domain name unless you’re willing to pay an additional fee. That’s the difference between   and  . Additionally, you may be more limited in the design templates you have available unless you’re willing and able to create some of your own using HTML. As you can see from the chart above, there are limitations that come with the  . Monetizing blogs on free platforms is more difficult and, in most cases, they’ll show ads alongside your content. Those pesky advertisements allow the platforms to make money off your content to make up for the fact that you aren’t paying them directly. So before taking the easy road and opting for a free platform, consider the quality-of-life features you’re looking for and any long-term goals you may have for your blog. Self-hosted blogs will require an investment of capital, but it’s never too outrageous. Some hosting providers are specialized for hosting corporate blogs and websites while others can be used by everyday individuals. This step is only necessary if you picked a blogging platform that requires a host. If you didn’t, I’ll see you in the next section. For those of you that did pick a hosted platform, welcome! I see the vanity of a personalized domain name was appealing to you. Even Dorian Gray would gasp at the sheer blatancy of your excess. There are a multitude of hosting providers available that will allow you to pick a custom domain name then provide an install solution for whichever blog platform you chose.

The emails themselves will stay in your regular inbox once you “label” them, but will also be sorted into “folders” in your sidebar according to the labels you give them. In the end, it doesn’t really matter what you call them. Whether you need to sort emails for work, play, or potential blackmail material, we’ve got you covered.\xa0 Looking for a more in-depth breakdown of how to create folders in Gmail? Read on for detailed instructions, tips, and how to create folders on your desktop or jump ahead for how to do it from the Gmail app. Before you begin, open your inbox. Do this by going to gmail.com and logging in with your credentials.\xa0 You’re in? All right, let's get to it!\xa0 Gmail does not allow you to make a folder with nothing in it, so if you haven’t decided which emails you want to put in a folder, take a moment to do that now. Keep in mind you can always add or remove emails from the folder, so don’t stress out about it too much.\xa0 Select the email by checking the box next to it in your inbox. Click on the label icon in the top menu bar directly above your inbox. It looks like a small tab or arrow. This icon will not appear until you’ve selected at least one email, so if you can’t see the icon, make sure you have an email selected. Since you want to create a new folder, select “Create new” on the bottom of the dropdown menu. After you click on “Create new,” another menu will appear prompting you to give your new label a name. Type an appropriate name for the label/folder underneath “Label as.” The name you typed will appear in quotations next to “(create new).”\xa0 Click on this button to create the label. After you create the new label, another box will pop up asking you to choose a nesting option. If you want your label to stand alone, select “Create” then move on to the next step.\xa0 If you have a label you’ve already created that you would like your new label to nest under, select that label from the “Please select a parent” drop-down menu. Now that you’ve created a label, you can add other emails to it. Do this by selecting the emails you want to add from your inbox, clicking the label icon, then selecting the label you’d like to add to. You can remove emails from the label/folder the same way. Just select the email, click the label icon, and uncheck the label from the menu. You can organize on the go as well as from your desktop. Open the Gmail app on your mobile device and follow these instructions to create labels/folders. Click on the three bars on the top left to open the Gmail menu. Scroll down and you will see a “+ Create new” option. Select this option. You will then be prompted to name your label. Enter a name for the label where it says “Type the name.” on this screen. Once you’ve typed something, select “DONE” on the top right corner of your screen. From your inbox, select the emails you want to add to your new label in your inbox, then click on the three dots in the top right corner of your screen.\xa0 A menu will pop up. Click on “Move to” from this menu.\xa0 From there, select the label you would like to sort the emails under, and they will be sorted. Repeat this process to create as many labels as you need. You will find that there are a few other ways to do this in Gmail—experiment until you find the best method to suit your needs. Here’s to your inbox’s more organized future!

We’re talking double the conversions. Think about it this way: if a website visitor expects a webpage to load in less than five seconds, how long can you expect them to wait for the answer to a question? A day? An hour? Try 10 minutes or less. Instant messaging software has revolutionized how businesses communicate with prospects and generate leads. But while the role of   in digital marketing is on the rise, there’s still something to say for the human touch. We then enter the   vs.   for business debate. They bother have a lot to offer businesses and customers alike that are in need of assistance; however, choosing which one will yield the results needed isn’t always so clear. Here’s what you need to take into consideration when making the final decision. We are in a world run by virtual assistants. One assistant growing in popularity is the chatbot. A   is an instant messenger pre-programmed with responses. Located on your social media – Facebook Messenger is one chatbot you’re sure to be familiar with – or your website, a chatbot creates guided conversation with users needing answers.\xa0  can be signaled with rules using   or even pick up on context clues. This allows for customers to get in contact with your business without the inconvenience of a wait time and without your company needing an actual person on the other side of the screen.\xa0 Live chat for business is a variation of your standard chatbot. The difference is that this real-time, instant messaging software puts visitors in contact with a human representative.\xa0 A trained agent can answer customer service queries, take down lead information, and more in a matter of minutes. This all allows you to build a personal connection with a chatter and provide case-by-case solutions, all while increasing your potential to engage with new, potential business and maintaining trust with repeat customers.\xa0 When we’re talking about instant messaging, we’re not referring to the early 2000s and AIM. Instant messaging systems have come a long way, and are a direct line to your getting online visitors into the funnel. Live chat and chatbots are directly correlated to an increase in sales, higher customer satisfaction, improved bounce rate, and more repeat customers. This is because chat systems are proactive. They start the conversation with the visitor, providing a convenient place for communication to take place rather than having the visitor search for the answer.\xa0 Not to mention, messaging systems come with an affordable price tag with a quicker return on investment than traditional methods of B2C communication, including phone and email. First things first: Why are considering using a messaging system? Do you want to convert more website visitors? Are you looking to sell tickets to events? Or are you trying to improve customer satisfaction in general? Live chat and chatbots have their respective strengths and weaknesses. So, having a clear view of your goals and what you hope to achieve with a messaging system will give help you stay on track moving forward. Step two in determining live chat or a chatbot is figuring out where the missed connections are. If you have a growing community on social media and are seeing messages come in with frequently asked questions, then a chatbot may be exactly what you need. For instance, Facebook Messenger allows you to set up answers in a rule-based conversation. This means certain words or phrases trigger a message, guiding the chatter to provide the necessary information. But, if you have website visitors that are never making their way to checkout after filling up a cart, live chat could be the answer to yours and their question. 50% of consumers say having an actual person available to answer their questions during online shopping is on of the most important features of a buying experience. On average, it can take a business up to 12 hours to respond via email. On social media, you’re looking at about 10 hours of wait time. Live chat and chatbots cut wait times down significantly, making them the preferred method of contact. When weighing the efficiency of live chat or a chatbot, you need to consider what your customer is asking. Are visitors more-so needing basic information, including store hours, return policies, or contact information? Or are inquiries technical, like product usage details, quotes, or appointment scheduling?\xa0 Live chat excels when it comes to the complicated, technical messages. A human agent can provide an answer and solution in two minutes or less, on average. But, live chat falters when it’s not business hours. Say your agent is only online Monday through Friday 9 AM to 5 PM. What happens after hours? Typically, a contact form is available for the agent to address queries come the next morning, racking up your response time and number of potential customers without assistance. Chatbots, on the other hand, answer instantaneously no matter the time or day. This appeases the   brands should have 24/7 service. Automated responses are pre-written, allowing for guided conversation to occur with ease on your website and social media without necessitating man or woman power. The goal of both live chat and chatbots is to provide clear communication between a chatter and a company. Chatbots can answer the simplest of questions with ease, and so can live chat. However, live chat takes the cake here. Bots are still limited when it comes to human interaction. Context and intent are not exact sciences, and most chatters are using instant messaging for a select few things, including emergency resolution, resolving complaints, getting detailed answers to a question, and finding a human customer service assistant. A human agent is able to gauge a chatter’s mood, comprehend technical language, and adjust on a dime for unique requests. This aspect of live chat alone can score you more leads and happy customers. Truth be told, both of these systems are really self-explanatory, assuming your average user understands how a chatbot works. On a chatbot, a user typically engages with guided conversation. They might be prompted with call-to-action buttons or automated questions. In a live chat window, the user has all of the control. They lead the conversation with their question and an agent follow suit. Surprisingly, the freedom of live chat makes things simpler – which isn’t always the case when it comes to customer service and lead generation. Asking a chatter to categorize their inquiry on a chatbot isn’t always intuitive. A live chat is just like any other conversation, meaning there’s no learning curve. There’s no beating around the bush. People trust people. Seriously. Think about how often you’ve had to ask for a representative on the phone. Bots and technology warrant skepticism and users aren’t always so keen on sharing personal information with an automated system. Knowing that there’s another human being on the other side of the chat, gives live chat a huge upper hand here. In fact,   that having a live person answer questions in the middle of a purchasing decision is one of the most important features a brand can offer.Live chat agents use familiar language, understand buyers’ and website visitors’ needs firsthand, and can express empathy. These small details are oftentimes what will lead to a conversion. One of the greatest things about both live chat and chatbots is the affordability. A managed live chat system shouldn’t run you more than a couple hundred dollars a month using a third-party service. And when it’s up and running and you’re closing more website traffic, it’ll definitely be worth the investment. Chatbots, when outsourced, can run you about the same as live chat. However, it’s not impossible to set up your own chatbot, especially when you’re using a well-established platform like Facebook. Be sure to work the numbers backwards. Evaluate how much an online lead is worth to you to determine what you should putting into your new messaging system. Well, if you haven’t gathered already, it’s completely situational. After taking every aspect of the buyer experience into consideration, you need to assess your company values and where you stand in terms of communication with your online visitors. Are you looking for the quickest route to a possible answer for a busy prospect, or are you trying to establish a connection in hopes of earning a repeat buyer? Live chat and chatbots both have a lot of value to offer, and at the end of the day, when done right, can both give your business’s digital strategy the boost it needs.\xa0 ', 'From helping people book their flight tickets or presenting them with shopping suggestions online, chatbots are everywhere.  are increasingly being used to engage customers, deliver useful content, influence purchase decisions and enhance customer service. The good news is that consumers are open to this change.   want to see more companies using chatbots. However, as much as chatbots are revolutionizing the way people interact with brands, the truth is that no one enjoys speaking to a machine. It’s frustrating when customers have to repeat themselves or when they’re met with unhelpful, template-like answers. So, how do you build a chatbot without making it sound like a machine? Let\'s find out. Let’s take a look at seven effective ways to make your chatbot sound human and deliver a personalized experience. What seems more welcoming: a chatbot titled BOT, or one named ‘Paul’ with an actual picture?  Giving your chatbot a human name and face is the first step toward making it sound like a real person. It’s easier for people to get familiar with the chatbot and trust it to resolve their issues when it’s coming from one that’s human-like. Apart from giving it a name and face, it’s also advisable to chalk out personality traits for your chatbot that are in line with your target audience’s expectations. For instance, is your chatbot a man, woman, or is it  ? Is it chatty or formal? Is it enthusiastic or matter-of-fact? Is it irreverent or respectful? Knowing the answers to these questions sets the foundation for the script and conversation. So, give your chatbot a name, face, and personality so your customers feel like they’re speaking to a human. Here’s an example of Amtrak’s chatbot named Julie, posing a human name and face. \xa0 Conversational marketing has grown to become an effective tool to attract, delight and engage customers. Gone are the days when a promotional piece of content or advertisement would hold the same influential power it once did.\xa0 Today, it’s all about having a two-way conversation, personalizing responses and giving instant solutions, which makes creating a powerful, value-driven chatbot conversation strategy extremely important. The first step is to develop a conversation flow. Conversation flow is a flow diagram that constitutes all the possible scenarios the chatbot can be met with and the corresponding outcomes. This needs to be developed keeping the user journey in mind and the kind of experience you want to deliver. Once you have the conversation flow ready, you can   and work on the script. Remember to keep conversations short and succinct to avoid overwhelming the user with blocks of text. Context forms an essential part of our everyday conversations, so why shouldn’t the same reflect in chatbot conversations? There is nothing more annoying for a customer than to not be understood. Here’s an example. A buyer is looking for espadrilles on a fashion e-commerce website. She is unable to remember what they’re called, and ends up explaining what they look like instead of using the word ‘espadrilles’. This can result in a harrowing customer experience if the chatbot is only designed to identify keywords. To prevent miscommunication, while developing a chatbot, it’s important to incorporate context to ensure it detects user intent. That’s what makes it engaging, helpful, and relevant. An effective way to achieve that is by asking questions to understand the customer rather than urging them to make a purchase or asking them for their email id and leaving it at that. When you ask questions and gather information, you’re able to offer solutions and create a more contextual customer experience. Imagine using a chatbot to order groceries and having to repeat your address and number every time you use it. Tiresome, isn’t it? One of the biggest advantages of a chatbot is that it helps you enhance customer service but how many companies are using this feature and making data for work for them? Not too many. Maintaining a repository of the right customer details and leveraging them during customer interactions helps deliver a personalized user experience. That’s not all, though. Chatbots can also be programmed to track product pages visited, website behavior, search terms, past chatbot conversations, and buying behavior to put together insights that can add value to conversations. Integrating the two will help you know your customers better, create relevant content and offer quick solutions. You land on a website, a chatbot pops up with a GIF of someone waving - it instantly catches your attention and makes you want to engage with it. This is exactly why it’s a good idea to  , images, emojis, videos and other types of multimedia content in chatbot conversations. Not only do they humanize your chatbot, but they are also a fun way to express emotions and make for a more relatable and casual conversation. When you’re incorporating rich content, make sure it’s line with your bot’s personality and the message you’re trying to communicate is crystal clear. That said, don’t make the mistake of over-doing it because that can get annoying and defeat the purpose. You can consider using rich media when you’re trying to break up long blocks of text or replace generic statements or reactions (e.g. greeting message, haha, wow, etc.). Here’s an example of Monty, G2’s bot. Notice how it casually inserts a GIF in the conversation, as a greeting?\xa0 Adding humor is always tricky because it’s subjective; what’s hilarious to one person might be offensive to another. However, when you’re looking to make your chatbot sound human, humor is certainly an element you can play around with. It adds to your bot’s personality and helps build relationships. The trick is to strike a balance between using humor appropriately in line with the context and sentiment of the users and not have it offend them. A great place to use humor is when you’re trying to break the ice because a witty or comical message does manage to grab people’s attention and reels them in to engage. Another place humor works is when you’re trying to cover up a mistake as it’s an effective way to lighten the situation and ease matters. Adding humor also hugely depends on the kind of brand you are. For instance, a weather bot can inject humor but you\'d rather not have a hospital chatbot be "funny". An example of a bot that does this well is Woebot, an online psychologist chatbot developed by a clinical psychologist.  (NLP) is a tool to help computers understand, interpret and derive meaning from natural, human language. The idea behind NLP is to bridge the gap between human and computer communication. Adding NLP humanizes your chatbot and improves chatbot performance. NLP does not just identify keywords, it enables chatbots to understand the intent of the user’s message so they’re able to give a tailored response. How does NLP work? Once the chatbot receives a request, it analyzes it as per the algorithm, identifies intent and entities and composes a suitable reply. For example, if you type, “what’s the weather in Spain tomorrow,” your intent is to get weather information and the entities are ‘Spain’ and ‘tomorrow’. NLP is a highly beneficial investment as it leads to increased customer satisfaction and elevates their experience. As a company incorporates a chatbot, it’s important to go the extra mile and take efforts to make your chatbot sound human. Customers want to be heard and understood which is only possible when they’re speaking to a chatbot that responds the way a human would. Your chatbot is the voice of your brand and it needs to deliver a personalized experience that delights customers. Remember: chatbots are a machine, but they don’t have to sound like one.\xa0 ', "Facebook may be for social connections between families and friends, but its Messenger platform is home to over 300,000 customer service, marketing, and sales   – and this number isn’t slowing down anytime soon. But what exactly is a chatbot? How does one even operate? What does this mean for   and business strategies moving forward? Facebook believes these automated messages could help businesses immensely as we move forward in this digital age. Here are some numbers to back up this claim: While 300,000 chatbots sound like a lot, it actually equates to   of businesses on Facebook taking advantage of the technology. If the numbers above indicate anything, it’s that more businesses should look toward Messenger and its chatbot capabilities to bolster their social media marketing strategies and stay competitive in the near future. That’s why we’ve compiled a full guide on why you should consider getting your Facebook chatbot up-and-running. Does anyone here remember when   launched in 1997? I may have been young at the time, but I remember spending hours asking Cleverbot pointless questions and getting less-than-optimal answers. These interactions, however, weren’t for nothing. Because Cleverbot is powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and not pre-programmed, it is constantly learning how humans interact and the ways we frame our questions. Since 1997, Cleverbot has learned from nearly 300 million interactions with humans. Little did we know that going down the endless Cleverbot rabbit hole would help pave the way for future chatbots – ones that would be much more valuable to businesses. We may not be fully aware of it, but many of us hold conversations with chatbots just about every week. Some of today’s most widely-used chatbots include Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant, and Apple’s Siri. I’m guessing a few of these sound familiar. The use of digital assistants is on the rise and more people are taking to chatbots as a first point-of-contact with businesses. While chatbots have traditionally supported customer service departments, more businesses are now using them to automate marketing and sales efforts. For a simple entry point into the chatbot world, look no further than Facebook Messenger. Amongst all mobile chat apps, Facebook Messenger ranks second with about   worldwide. Facebook, however, still remains as the   network, with   of U.S. adults obtaining a profile, making Facebook marketing a goldmine for social media marketing teams. This means if you have a   (you should really create one if you haven’t already), there’s a good chance a user will engage with your chatbot to learn more about your business. If you’re still not swayed to use Messenger as the platform for your first chatbot, take a look at the top five advantages: Facebook chatbots are live at all hours of the day and send near-instant responses to user inquiries. Even if a chatbots sole purpose is to answer FAQs, it still frees up valuable time for your   staff. Since Facebook actually grades businesses on how responsive they are to messages, users will feel confident that their questions will be answered in a timely manner. Besides, you don’t want a potential customer lingering, do you? On the note of potential customers, Facebook chatbots are great for engaging with those who have discovered you via Facebook and are ready to purchase something from your   business. With   capabilities, your Facebook chatbot can identify which item the customer is looking for and connect them to that item via   (CTA) buttons in a matter of seconds. A recent study by DigitasLBi revealed that   of U.S. adults are willing to make a purchase via chatbots – with the average purchase totaling $55. Clear CTAs and a seamless checkout cart will boost customer confidence when making a purchase. Leads are an important part of any marketing strategy, especially when it comes to B2B marketing. Any of your current followers or users who have engaged with your business page at some point are now part of your subscriber list on Facebook. What does this mean for your business? Well, both current customers and customers in your scope can be targeted via Messenger for relevant offers, coupon codes, blog content, and more. Facebook chatbots are the deliverers of these messages. Since customers are much more likely to open a Facebook message compared to email, you can expect higher engagement rates. One of the advantages of utilizing a Facebook chatbot is its ability to retain tons of data from customer conversations. When this data is put into action, it can lead to more targeted social media and omnichannel marketing strategies. Facebook Analytics is a good starting point for visualizing the activity of your Messenger bot. You can see how many total users are engaging with the bot, the demographics of these users, and the retention rate. There are other analytic tools, however, that provide more in-depth insight to your chatbots’ performance. Some of these tools unveil who the most engaged users are what drives them to continually use your chatbot. Other tools show which messages have the highest conversion rates. People are more open to using chatbots now than ever – and this isn’t just because of the added efficiency. Some of the top-performing Facebook chatbots today provide a personalized, branded experience to its users. For some inspiration on how to provide a similar experience, we’ve listed some of these chatbots below. While all Facebook chatbots are implemented with the purpose to increase efficiency, some are doing their jobs better than others. Here are 5 brands utilizing chatbots to drive the efforts of marketing, sales, or customer service: Jeff Jenkins, Whole Foods’ Global Executive of Digital Strategy and Marketing,   that were are living in the “expectation economy,” and that consumers would like to be equipped with relevant content by brands they follow. This sentiment served as the basis of Whole Foods’ Facebook chatbot, which launched in 2016. The main purpose of this chatbot is to connect Whole Foods followers with unique recipes. The chatbot takes in a variety of information about the user, such as dietary restrictions and protein preferences. After a recipe is selected, the user can either go with it or opt out for a new one. Some other neat features of the Whole Foods’ chatbot include processing emojis, linking up to customer rewards, saving recipes for later, and allowing users to signup and receive coupons. One of the top cosmetic brands in the world found a new way to serve customers and increase engagement through its easy-to-use Facebook chatbot. Labeled the Sephora Assistant, this chatbot gained in popularity after Sephora ran a   for U.S. women ages 18-49. When the ad was clicked, the bot would open in Messenger and guide users through a three-step scheduling feature. The results? An 11 percent higher booking rate of in-store makeup appointments. By utilizing a user’s GPS location to connect them with the nearest store, the booking sequence was also reduced by five steps. Now the chatbot is considered one of Facebook’s top performers. Having to hop on Google to find the latest, most relevant news to your liking can be time-consuming. The Wall Street Journal decided a Facebook chatbot that curated news for its users would be the best way to counter this issue. Through clear CTAs, users can customize which content is fed to them through the chatbot. The longer the user engages with the chatbot, the more tailored their newsfeed will be. This is the power of AI. Let’s face it, our smartphones are full of applications that rarely get used on a regular basis. If you’re adverse to downloading yet another app just to order a pizza, you can jump on Facebook Messenger and place your next order through Pizza Hut’s chatbot. In similar fashion to Sephora’s chatbot, Pizza Hut has reduced the amount of steps needed to finalize an order. Fewer steps equal faster delivery, which also equals more time to consume however much pizza your heart desires. Pizza Hut’s chatbot collects transaction data for an even faster checkout experience your next time through. It also uses this data to suggest new items or promotions – providing franchisees with up-sell opportunities. Mastercard, one of the leading financial service providers, recognized the widespread adoption of chatbots and decided to implement its own on Facebook Messenger for both banks and merchants. By utilizing  , which dissects human language in a more sensible way for machines, the Mastercard chatbot has a robust set of features. For merchants, Mastercard has enabled customers with the Masterpass payment service to conduct transactions through the chatbot. This is great news for merchants that haven’t built their own chatbots but would like the added efficiency of one. Mastercard has also empowered customers to communicate with their banks via the chatbot. For example, users can check their bank accounts, purchase history, and even ask the chatbot to monitor spending habits. This is a great example of a chatbot that provides value to both users and businesses. There is, of course, the looming question of “how much is this going to cost me?” Fortunately, Facebook chatbots are actually free to build and implement, however, it does require some technical skills. Depending on the complexity of your chatbot and the type of conversations its expected to have, you may need to seek external help developing it. For example, a chatbot with pre-programmed responses could be developed quickly, while a chatbot that utilizes natural language processing may take longer. For a more in-depth explanation on how to build your Facebook chatbot, check out Facebook’s   for developers. Whether you’re just releasing your Facebook chatbot, or figuring out ways a chatbot will be valuable to your business, here are four universal best practices for getting the most out of this technology. As mentioned before, chatbots collect a variety of data on each user that engages with one. In the age of GDPR and with so much concern around personal data protection, it’s worth being upfront with your customers. While it's difficult to give users   control over which data they share, you could provide a few ways for them to opt in or opt out. The example above prompts the user to check out a privacy agreement and asks for permission before storing the user’s name and Facebook ID. You may be thinking to yourself, “Wait, I thought the whole purpose of a Facebook chatbot was to remove a human intermediary and free up customer support for other tasks?” This is true for the most part, but like humans, chatbots are prone to making mistakes. Sometimes a chatbot has difficulty understanding the user’s intent. The question may not be clear, or there could be a typo that limits the chatbots ability to answer correctly. Other times, a chatbot can drop the ball completely – and this could end up annoying the user more often than not. Unfortunately, 73 percent of U.S. adults said they would ditch a chatbot after one bad experience. A   resonated this claim, stating that 61 percent of people find faulty chatbots more annoying than human representatives. This is why it is key to have employees with strong customer service skills on-hand. Customers using your Facebook chatbot could face unexpected issues. This is why you should be proactive about inviting feedback from users. This is especially true for newly-implemented chatbots. Missteps are inevitable, but that doesn’t mean you should be complacent when they occur. Part of learning is running into mistakes, testing new solutions, and measuring those solutions. Run   feedback surveys to help better your messenger bot. Facebook chatbots aren’t here to entertain users. Their objectives are to save time, increase brand awareness, and serve as an additional arm to your marketing, sales, and customer service departments. While personalization is great for a chatbot, keeping answers as clear and concise as possible is sure to retain users. The image above is a great example of how CNN’s chatbot condensed an article that is thousands-of-words long in just a few sentences. Facebook chatbots – or any chatbot for that matter – aren’t perfect by any means. However, the ways they automate even small business processes demonstrates why chatbot technology is on the rise. As a matter of fact, chatbot conversations are on track to save businesses nearly   in productivity by 2022. A reported   of businesses see AI (which powers chatbots) as crucial for reducing operational costs. Although, many of these businesses haven’t devised a plan to use this technology or feel they have the expertise to do so. Facebook Messenger, however, has emerged as one of the simpler platforms to apply AI technology. With only 300,000 Facebook chatbots currently live, now is a great time to enhance your Facebook marketing strategy with a chatbot.

The biggest city and capital of Indiana, Indianapolis has a tourism board that other mid-tier cities should be very jealous of, specifically carving out a niche in the professional sports industry. Since 2006 Indianapolis has hosted Super Bowl XLVI, 3 NCAA Men’s Final Fours (2006, 2010, 2015), and 2 NCAA Women’s Final Fours (2011, 2016). The city is also the home of the NFL Scouting Combine (1987-present), the Big Ten Football Championship (2011-present) and the largest single-day sporting event in the world in the Indianapolis 500 (400,000 people). The city has the Final Four again in 2021, as well as the NBA All-Star Game in the same year and is the home to the NCAA headquarters. Whew. That’s a star-studded resume for the 25th- largest metropolitan city in the United States. And while Indianapolis has had large corporations and companies call the city home already (Cummins, Rolls-Royce, Eli Lilly, Anthem), it wasn’t until the early 2000s that Indy’s tech scene became a foundation for the city. That would be when ExactTarget was founded. The digital marketing software company exploded, growing to over 1,500 employees, expanding to six global offices, and acquiring companies such as CoTweet, Pardot, iGoDigital and Keymail. The company went public in 2012 and was eventually acquired by Salesforce in 2013 for a massive $2.5 billion, and has since rebranded as Salesforce Email Studio. But that was just the start for the city’s tech scene. In 2016,   it was moving into the previous Chase Tower, the tallest and signature skyscraper in downtown Indy. Salesforce has promised the city 800 jobs and mapped out a plan to train 500 apprentices in Indianapolis by 2020. But the good news for Indy didn’t end there. After selling the company, ExactTarget CEO Scott Dorsey co-founded venture studio High Alpha in the same city that brought ExactTarget enormous success. A former Indiana University Kelley School of Business graduate, Dorsey has stuck with Indianapolis, and the city has reaped the benefits. Through its unique studio model, High Alpha has cofounded and funded wildly successful Indianapolis startups such as  ,  ,   and   (along with investing in non-Indy based companies such as   and yes, even G2 Crowd). This momentum has led Indy to new heights outside of the Dorsey-portfolio as well. Angie’s List filed for an IPO at their valuation of over $900 million in 2011 and Aprimo sold for over $500 million in the same year. Hyde Park Venture Partners of Chicago also opened up their\xa0 \xa0in 2015, led by former ExactTarget CMO Tim Kopp, who joined the firm as managing partner in Indy.

Infosys also announced its plan to open its\xa0 \xa0in (you guessed it) Indianapolis that will create over 2,000 tech jobs in the city. Shortly after publication of this article, Zylo closed a $9 million Series A from Bessemer Venture Partners and help from Salesforce and Slack. That’s the largest Series A in Indy history. Indianapolis is now (like many cities) turning its attention to the biggest free agent on the market as it attempts to lure   to the city — as of press time, it is a   for HQ2. If successful, the city could be the next Austin or Denver, a mid-tier city catapulted into the tech spotlight. “ ” “ ” We have compiled data on the state of the Indianapolis B2B tech scene that includes all of the top-rated products on G2 Crowd which have parent companies headquartered in the Indianapolis area.

Too often, businesses   believing they will be beneficial for the organization, only to see them fail to deliver what was expected. According to PMI,   of every dollar is wasted on poor project management and execution. As a result, organizations waste an enormous amount of resources, including time, money, and personnel – executing tasks that won’t produce a return on investment. , a well-developed field around organizing and executing the tasks involved in a project, is certainly key to pulling off a project successfully, but it must also be accompanied by an element of  , a larger process that ensures strategic success. Project performance management is the process of creating, implementing, and managing projects that contribute to the performance of an organization and its strategy. Rather than focusing on task execution, project performance management is about the bigger picture. It focuses on three areas to ensure every project produces a business benefit: Project performance management is part of the larger performance management process; essentially, it’s all about leveraging your projects to execute your strategy. Continuously carrying out projects that fail to contribute to strategic objectives is not only a waste of time and resources, but also undermines your organization’s ability to stay competitive.  their projects are performing well, when in fact, one in three projects don’t meet their goals. Organizations that actively manage projects to align with strategy (and execute them well) means they’re doing better than many of their competitors at allocating resources in a way that directly contributes to the organization’s well-being. They are spending wisely, increasing profitability, saving time, and reducing waste. With a defined management and reporting process, you can track and adjust along the way. They are also creating a culture that is focused on organizational outcomes rather than project outcomes. A substantial amount of money is spent on these projects—sometimes as much as 20%–30% of an organization’s budget. Allowing projects to veer off course to meet departmental needs rather than organizational goals diminishes your ability to achieve those larger goals over time. Without a project performance management process in place, low-performing projects could become the norm.  (also called corporate performance management) is the concept of  : What are its goals? How will you measure them? What actions will you take to achieve improved results? Organizational performance management deals entirely with how you communicate, align around, and execute your strategy. The Balanced Scorecard (a strategic planning and management system that takes several organizational viewpoints in addition to the financial angle into account), EFQM Excellence Model, MPO, and Six Sigma, are all frameworks used to help manage corporate performance. Project performance management is a subset of organizational performance management. Many organizations have an OPM system that includes projects. If you have a separate project management office, make sure they are working closely with your OPM team. Only   of organizations with an enterprise-wide project management office report that it is highly aligned to the organization's strategy. Employee performance management is a subset of human resources that seeks to improve employee productivity, satisfaction, and operational capability. This area focuses on competency building, closing skill gaps, and guiding employees careers, promotions, raises, and normal reviews. It is related to project performance management and organizational performance management in the sense that you need qualified employees to run projects, and you need to make sure you have the right staff with the right skills for your overall strategy. Even if a project is completed on time and on target as far as budget and scope, that’s not enough to declare it a success. The true measure of a successful project is if it meets that criteria –  whether or not it actually contributes to a strategic business objective. To go beyond managing the technical elements and keep projects on track strategically, follow the six steps below.\xa0 Most organizations have more projects than they can handle. Too often, projects are proposed not for the good of the organization but to benefit a particular department. For example, an IT department might want to purchase and implement a specific software solution because it has cool features, not because it will help accomplish a business goal. The value of all projects should be questioned before putting them into play. Thus, every project needs a well-defined business case:   At this stage you should also consider alternatives to the project you’re proposing, and whether or not your proposition will generate the most value. To simplify this step, create a “business plan” template you can use across projects, outlining the goals, costs, and timing of each project (including the indirect cost of people’s time), and show how each project will drive better results over time. Review this document often throughout the execution phase. Goals provide clear direction for projects, specifying exactly what you expect they will accomplish. Be realistic about what the project will really support. Some organizations put rules in place that prevent projects from linking to more than two or three goals (to keep the projects focused). Many municipal organizations require departments to link projects to the organization’s current   to show how investing in a project will drive long-term results. That way, all projects that get funded are clearly linked to the strategy in a transparent way. There’s a lot written about the “triple constraints” of project management: time, scope, and cost: These data points should always be part of your performance management process, and you should be able to track them with ease. But there will also be measures outside of these that will change depending on the goals your project is trying to improve. For example, your organization may have a long-term strategic vision to become more sustainable. A related project might be to implement an Internet of Things monitoring system to reduce your organization’s water use. In addition to managing the traditional data points listed above, this particular project would have a data point around water use specifically. How much water will you save as a result of this project? Such an improvement should be directly impacting a data point that already exists in the organizational strategy. The business environment changes quickly, which is why it’s imperative to continuously track progress toward   your data points (not just project-driven measures). If, for instance, a new technology has entered the market that affects your organization or project, you need to be nimble and aware, and ready to make a change in your data points. Projects have many different steps, and while a project may have a single project manager, the tasks associated with reaching different milestones may be owned by different individuals. Whether you’re using an agile approach or a waterfall approach to project management, the mini-steps within a project all need to be managed well. The deadlines within these projects may have dependencies that cause major disruptions. For instance, you may not be able to add new features to a software without the foundations of the database in place. Or you may not be able to pave or light a construction tunnel if the walls are not stable and equipment is moved. It is worth preparing all the steps in your projects and understanding the interrelationships and dependencies if they exist. Never assume projects will run smoothly. Regular meetings are a good forum for working out issues and checking on progress related to both individual projects and project portfolios. Your project may have run into a technical challenge that forces a decision or a change in scope, timing, or cost that could impact all the other project milestones. Or, your organization may be experiencing budget cuts or some other business uncertainty that is completely unrelated to the project, but could still cause a change or delay to its execution. You’ll also want to create management reports to show progress. Reports should include project start and end dates, percent complete, spending to date, and any key steps and checkpoints (milestones) in the project. Sometimes, the easiest way to show this information is through a Gantt chart. Meetings about individual projects should occur fairly frequently, even daily or weekly depending on the project. Larger organizational meetings usually occur monthly or quarterly to discuss the projects within the context of the strategy. No matter what the project, it’s important to do a wrap-up at the end, signaling you have moved from project implementation to “business as usual”. For example, a software implementation could spiral into a never-ending project if you consider that there will always be new software releases and new features to add. Your project team needs to have clear boundaries on when to stop the project and transition the management of the software to the sales and marketing teams. The same goes for transitioning from a construction project to a maintenance projec . The Big Dig in Boston took 13 years, and by the time it was complete, there was already maintenance ongoing to the roads, bridges, and tunnels involved with the project. At the end of each project, it’s helpful to pull together a project summary and an after-action review (AAR). The AAR is essentially made up of two parts: The discussion should include members of the leadership team and departments who benefited from the implementation of the project. You should be measuring the results of each of your projects as they finish, and looking at your portfolio of projects each month or quarter. When projects finish, track their effectiveness and AAR, and use the information to improve future projects. When you review your portfolio, it should be for strategic alignment and effective use of resources within the context of the bigger strategy. Create a table to help guide your review, thinking about each individual step of the project process. It’s to be expected that your methods of performance management system will change over time. What information do your leaders want to see? It may be different than what you presented for a previous project, and you may need to make adjustments for different audiences. This is normal, and you should be prepared to adapt. That goes for the tools you’re using (ideally, software) to carry out the process as well. It should be flexible enough to evolve with your needs, while serving as a hub for all the strategic data you’re gathering across your organization. An organization’s competitiveness depends in part on its ability to complete projects profitably. The performance management process ensures that projects remain profitable not just in the technical sense, but also in a strategic sense, so that every project drives organizational improvement. Companies that develop a comprehensive approach to align projects to their business strategy, and then track and manage them well, are better positioned to reach their goals because they can distill high-level strategic visions into tangible actions. That’s what drives high-performing organizations forward – and sets them apart from the competition. ", 'Avengers, assemble!\xa0 When this phrase is uttered, all participating superheroes know what to do: use their particular power to solve the problem at hand. Although professional project teams often function without a catchphrase, the idea is the same: a team of talented specialists, led by a project manager, unite and use their unique strengths to solve a common problem. For this reason, you should choose your project team carefully, with consideration as to who would best accomplish certain jobs, and who best fills each role. A stellar project team begins with a stellar project manager, so be sure to first check out the "14   to Look for in a Hire." But if you’re ready to get the ball rolling on the task at hand, you’ll benefit from understanding the various roles that play a part in the  . In this article, I’ll walk you through the varying roles that make up a project team, as well as the responsibilities associated with each. First, let’s go over the different roles that a project team consists of, and what part they play within the greater team dynamic. The project manager (PM) is the practical leader of the whole operation. PMs are responsible for writing a business case, determining the project’s budget, creating a project schedule, assigning individual tasks to team members, and monitoring a project’s progress. While a PM may not work on the project itself, they facilitate all the surrounding details and information. \xa0 For example, if a PM is contracted to help a company create a new website, that PM would strategize for and plan the project, but would then hire design or UX professionals to execute the project tasks.\xa0 Additional responsibilities for a project manager are: writing the executive summary, communicating with upper management and stakeholders, and deciding which project methodology would best suit the task at hand. For example, which should win in a decision of  ? It’s the PM’s job to figure this out. A project team member is any individual who contributes to the success of a project. Team members can be internal employees, or external hires contracted for temporary work. For example, a project manager may need to contract a web designer if they don’t currently have anyone with that skill set onboard.\xa0 \xa0 Team members are responsible for their contributions and roles as individuals, which vary depending on their title and the project’s needs. In short, a team member’s responsibility is to do their assigned tasks effectively and efficiently, communicate progress with managers, and ensure the project is able to move on to the next step in the process. A business analyst’s role on the project team is to aid the project manager in determining the best course of action. Essentially, a business analyst uses his or her skills of interpreting direction and understanding objectives to help keep steer your project in the best direction.\xa0 On the project team, a business analyst is responsible for setting clear boundaries within the scope of the project, and keeping a record of any technical needs. Project stakeholders, also referred to as the project sponsors, are individuals who project managers answer to. These team players are usually in an upper-management role and had a hand in approving the project as a necessary venture.\xa0 Stakeholders are invested in the progress of a project, as it could affect their bottom line or other business success. A stakeholder is responsible for determining the need for the project, and approving the best course of action. They also closely monitor progress through reports or data submitted by the project manager. Stakeholders ensure all members of the team have what they need to accomplish their goals, and they keep others in the organization up-to-date on project executions. Consider an executive stakeholder to be like a “big boss,” whose authority is greater than the project stakeholder. It is important for this individual to agree with the proposed project deliverables and objectives. This stakeholder will be necessary if the project manager determines a need for excess funds or resources, or a change in the project’s scale. The secret to succeeding in business? You have to try, and try really hard. Project managers are responsible for creating a dynamic team, facilitating clear communication among team members, and troubleshooting if or, more likely, when, things go awry. But with amazing key players, organizations can accomplish great things. ', '\xa0I am a planner. If I’m going on vacation, I want to know what I’m doing every second of every day. I’ve learned, the hard way, that other people are not planners. Some are okay to improvise their days, wandering into whatever cafes or nightclubs they happen to pass. As someone who works in  , regardless of your vacationing style, you  bring a plan to work. Projects require an immense amount of time and resources, and it’s best to not assign such responsibilities in a lackadaisical way. Set your   up for guaranteed success by providing them with a legitimate, well-thought-out project plan. Creating a successful project plan requires a project manager to put in the work. Nothing good ever comes to those who don’t try. Unless of course, they’re privileged. But that’s neither here nor there. In order to put your best foot forward, follow through on these steps. Research your project enough to understand what you should expect. What will your challenges be? Have other companies tried this project in the past? What should you budget for? What’s the scope of your project, and what deliverables are you aiming to achieve? Determine how you are going to judge your own success. What criteria will the project be judged on?\xa0 Additionally, do research into how long your project and the accompanying milestones should take to complete. Developing a schedule is pertinent to your success, so have a clear understanding of your timeline. Once you have all of the vital details burned into your brain, create a rough breakdown of the work, or an outline to help you visualize the upcoming steps. This breakdown will typically include elements such as: If your team is already assembled, then it’s time to lay the project research and outline out in front of them. It’s important to be in constant contact with your employees so they understand the strategies needed to reach success. Allow your team to have input. They’re the ones who will be carrying the project out. If they don’t think a certain milestone can be hit in a week, this is their chance to speak up and help you adjust expectations. Now that you’ve done all the research and gotten a clear OK from your team, it’s time to record all of your findings. This is the part of the plan that will be presented to stakeholders, whether on its own or as part of a larger  .\xa0 You should record your plan according to your team or company’s best practices. Do you use  ? Do it that way. Are you more familiar with a PERT chart? Then do it that way.\xa0 \xa0 Regardless of the format, a project plan should consist of the following: All that’s left now is to publish your plan and submit it to all related parties. Stakeholders, team members: everyone who is a part of the plan or will be affected by it should have access to the finished product. Now that you know what goes into a successful project plan, you’re ready to get started on building that house, or redesigning your company website. Remember to plan ahead, and leave the improv to all the struggling comedy performers in Chicago. '], 5: ['Working from home is becoming increasingly common. Yet, when people tell their friends they’re working from home, they’re usually met with skepticism and flippant accusations like, "Oh, you\'re just watching Netflix, aren\'t you?" It\'s easy to assume   leads to less productivity, but in reality, it\'s usually quite the opposite. Keeping remote employees engaged and on track isn’t impossible. In fact, it can help boost productivity. As   at least once per week, remote work is beneficial for a reboot and recharge while maintaining a strong work ethic away from the office. The   people choose to work remotely is for increased productivity and better focus.\xa0 But we\'re still human. We get distracted by full dishwashers, the temptation to watch the last GoT episode, or countless other potential interruptions we face when we\'re home for the workday.\xa0 To help you with   and remain optimally productive, we\'ve compiled this list of 9 ways to stay focused when you\'re working from home.\xa0 Working from home isn\'t an excuse to stay tucked under your covers well past noon. To ensure you remain productive when you\'re remote, find a space in your home to dedicate to work – and only work.\xa0 If you don\'t have a full office space at home, try clearing off a desk in your living room or creating an office environment by moving a notepad and lamp to your kitchen table. Alternatively, if you don\'t feel productive in your home, check out nearby coffee shops or  . Ultimately, it\'s important you have a space that signals to your brain that it\'s time to focus. Plus, it\'s equally critical you save spaces like your bedroom for relaxation, so you can continue to have good work-life balance. Otherwise, you might find yourself checking your email from your bed at 9 p.m. because you haven\'t mentally left the office.\xa0 It\'s difficult to feel productive when you\'re still in your pajamas at 10:30 a.m. and haven\'t showered or eaten breakfast yet. Without a constructive morning routine, you\'ll end up feeling like it\'s a Saturday morning, not a work morning.\xa0 To ensure productivity, a time management tip is to kick off your day with the same routine you\'d use if you were heading to the office. Make some coffee, take a shower, and put on a pair of jeans rather than staying in your bathrobe and slippers. Maintaining a morning routine helps you to mentally prepare for the day and get in a productive state-of-mind.\xa0 When you\'re working from home, there are often other demands you need to pay attention to: cooking, taking your dog for a walk, picking a child up from daycare, or switching laundry from the washer to the dryer, to name a few. To maintain focus throughout the day, it\'s crucial to set a schedule and stick to it.\xa0 For instance, if you\'re most productive first thing in the morning, try tackling your most difficult tasks right when you wake up. Later in the day you can complete easier tasks, like responding to emails or editing a blog post while you multitask on some of those other non-office-related responsibilities. Additionally, if you work both in the office and remotely, choose which tasks you\'re going to accomplish better at home and which you should save for the office. For instance, you might decide Monday and Tuesday are your in-office days and plan all your meetings for those days. Then, on Wednesday, your schedule can revolve around solitary work you know you can get done better at home. Even if you\'re not a morning person, you should really make a point of getting yourself together before too much time has passed.\xa0 One of the most obvious differences between   and conducting your job at an office is the commute. However much flexible work is becoming more and more a part of our daily lives, the commute provides a bookend to the day and, in that sense, continues to define what a workday actually is.\xa0 Of course, eliminating the actual act of sitting on public transportation or being stuck in traffic is a net benefit to anyone\'s day. Despite this, getting yourself into your to-do list as early as possible can do wonders for affording flexibility to the rest of your day. Without the social or managerial pressure to remain focused, it can be tempting to mindlessly peruse Instagram or quickly shop online when you\'re home alone. To ensure productivity, you must employ tactics to eliminate unnecessary distractions. For starters, try keeping your phone in another room while you\'re working. If you feel compelled to check social media or respond to texts, schedule it into one of your daily breaks and use it as motivation by telling yourself, "If I finish this blog post, I can check Instagram for 20 minutes." Alternatively, you might try a tool like Freedom or  , which can temporarily block distracting websites like Facebook or Amazon while you work. If you think casually checking email or quickly opening Facebook isn\'t a big deal, consider this:   found that the typical office worker spends only 11 minutes on a task before getting interrupted, but once interrupted, it takes them about 23 minutes to get back on track. To ensure long-term productivity, implement strategies to ensure you don\'t get interrupted in the first place.\xa0 Surprisingly, we can often become so hyper-focused at home that we forget to take breaks, which can burn you out quickly. To ensure you find sustained focus throughout the day, it\'s critical you incorporate breaks into your schedule. Leave your apartment for a cup of coffee, go for a lunchtime cycle class, or grab lunch down the street.\xa0\xa0 To ensure you\'re consistently making wise professional decisions, take breaks to mentally refresh. While it might seem counterintuitive, regular breaks can actually make you more productive, particularly if your breaks include a form of exercise.\xa0 Additionally, breaks can help prevent decision fatigue. A   to prisoners after their two daily breaks. As decision fatigue sets in, however, the rate of granting parole dropped to nearly zero percent because judges resorted to the easiest option – just saying no.\xa0 The delineation between "work" and "home" is one of the first things to go when you become a remote worker.\xa0 If you\'re new to the work from home crew, you probably haven\'t spent much time thinking about how important this distinction is for your productivity and sanity. Blending the spaces where you work and relax can make it nigh impossible to hit the same levels of achievement you were able to get at the office, which is why it\'s important to set aside a room or a period of time where you work instead of engaging with the other elements of your "home" life.\xa0 Unfortunately, other people can become the biggest obstacles to achieving a solid work/home balance in your new remote setup. Setting boundaries with the other people you live with, particularly if they\'re your romantic partner, is critical for making sure you can have the necessary space and time you need to actually focus on the work you\'re supposed to be doing.\xa0 As\xa0mentioned above, breaks are critical. But if you\'re running to a lunchtime SoulCycle class, it\'s still important to communicate that to your manager or teammates. Since you\'re not in the office, your coworkers can\'t check your desk to see if you\'re available or not. Additionally, you\'ll be more productive if you set clear online and offline boundaries. If you need to take your dog for a walk, set an "Away" status on your  . At 5 p.m. (or whenever you choose to be done working for the day), don\'t respond to any more emails, so coworkers know you\'re unreachable until tomorrow. If possible, incorporate those times into your Gmail calendar so when you\'re offline, your coworkers will know why.\xa0 Ultimately, a good work-life balance is the only way you can stay productive (and sane) when working from home.\xa0 Checking off a to-do list is one of the simplest pleasures of a work day. When working from home, it\'s necessary to have specific goals you need to meet to ensure you stay on track when Netflix or your bed is calling your name.\xa0 Additionally, if it helps, try making yourself accountable by promising coworkers or your manager that you\'ll finish certain tasks by end-of-day. Then, break down the project into smaller intervals. For instance, if you\'re aiming to finish a presentation for tomorrow\'s meeting, give yourself the morning to collect data, take a break for lunch, and then urge yourself to finish the rough draft of the presentation by 2 p.m. Go for a walk, and then come back and look it over. It can be tricky to feel   for the day when you\'re working from home, and you might find yourself still responding to emails or editing your video far past normal work hours. But whether you\'re remote or in-office, work-life balance is still critical for long-term professional success.\xa0\xa0 To ensure proper balance, try setting up a logoff routine at a reasonable end time each day, regardless of how much you\'ve finished. Jot down a to-do list of tasks you want to tackle the next day, set an away status on your messaging apps, and put your work supplies back away until the morning.\xa0 Studies have found friendships in the workplace result in more productive teams. If you have close relationships with coworkers, you\'re more likely to collaborate with them and ask them for advice without fearing criticism, which can help you do a better job. Additionally, relationships in the workplace allow you to form a fuller picture on how your role plays into the company\'s larger goals, boosting your motivation and morale. However, working from home could hinder your ability to catch up with coworkers and form those deeper bonds like you would if you ran into them in the office kitchen. To combat this, it\'s vital to maintain connections with them through internal communication tools like Slack or   tools like Zoom. Set up regular 1:1 virtual meetings simply for the purpose of catching up so you\'re never out of the loop. And unfortunately, we can\'t avoid virtual presentations completely. Be sure to leverage   so other remote employees feel like they\'re in the room with you.\xa0 Even though you might have the luxury of sitting on your sofa while working from home, it doesn\'t mean you\'re not working. The work you do from home can be as productive\xa0 ', 'In recent years, a clear theme has emerged in the world of work: the mobile workforce is here to stay.  used to be something that buzzy startups used to attract millennials, but now it’s a necessity for every company. The question isn’t whether to start working remote or not; it’s about the best ways to make remote teams work for your business. There are a ton of advantages. In a recent  , executives at Chipotle and Mercato shared how video calls have helped them connect with their teams on a deeper level. Remote work also cuts costs. Reuters reports that   are reducing the square footage of their offices to save money. Still, remote work hasn’t been easy for every company to adopt. This has led to growing pains in some workplaces and innovation in others. Remote communication tools are more important than ever and you also need a great process to onboard new employees remotely.. Whether your company has aced remote work or struggled with it, you can expect the mobile workforce to keep growing. In fact, your success in the future depends on getting this right because remote teams are here to stay. Thanks to the growth of remote work, business as we know it has changed forever. Approximately   work from home full-time, according to research from Nicholas Bloom, Professor of Economics at Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences. The shift is so big that Bloom says we now live in a “working-from-home economy”. And it’s not just an American trend. In Europe,   started working from home for the first time in their careers this year. This is a change that spans far and wide and will last much longer than this moment. Though, workers and companies weren’t always so eager to work from home. Until recently, there was actually a social stigma around it. It was perceived that traditional office workers looked down on remote employees, viewing them as less motivated and productive. But a   found the opposite – 29% of surveyed workers shared that they were distracted easily at the office whereas 35% of remote workers found it easier to focus on work tasks at home. And now that so many people are working from home, they’re seeing for themselves that the stigma was unwarranted. Virtual operations have helped keep companies afloat during uncertain times, and they’ve helped employees thrive. “Work-from-home culture” is changing minds, and there will likely be less resistance to it from this point forward. Without a doubt, remote work is here to stay. Even when employers start bringing workers back to physical offices, Bloom predicts that   at least once a week. This means flexible scheduling and video conferences will be the new normal. But there will be even bigger changes in the workplace. We’ll see workers prioritizing balance and personal happiness over their careers. Companies shouldn’t panic – this is an opportunity to change the ways they find, keep, and connect with their teams. We tend to think of the mobile workforce in very literal terms – they’re a group of professionals who can literally work from anywhere, whether that’s the sandy shores of a resort in Bali or a coffee shop just blocks away from HQ. But it’s not just about where they can work; it’s also about where you can hire from. Recruiters aren’t limited to job candidates in one city. Now, they can search across borders and find the perfect employees in new and unexpected places. This is a big deal for business. Just think of all the job seekers who’ve been turned down or who didn’t even bother applying because they lived too far away. This is a big group: working parents, military spouses, differently abled workers, and caregivers, among others. These are talented people who’ve lost out on opportunities because they couldn’t make the commute or because relocation just wasn’t realistic. Remote work removes all of these barriers to entry. Remote work also means headhunters can tap into talent in emerging markets in Latin America and in Africa, which has become a  . Some of the world’s biggest companies are located in the world’s biggest cities where there’s plenty of opportunity. But those opportunities come at a cost – a high one. Previously, workers may have to cram into tiny, expensive apartments, or endure long commutes to work at a prestigious company (think Silicon Valley and San Francisco). Remote work is changing this. Employees are already leaving large, pricey, urban areas. Just look at New York City. Rents were already at record highs, and shutdowns caused an epic financial crisis. This was the breaking point for a lot of workers. Instead of weathering the storm, they traded the Big Apple for   in nearby states. And a recent survey found that   would leave the city if they were allowed to work from home permanently. Expect this trend to spread to other big cities around the U.S. and all over the world. According to real estate listing company Redfin,   are shopping for houses in the country or the suburbs, meaning they’re ready to make permanent moves. The mobile workforce doesn’t need to live near your headquarters to do their jobs. They can go elsewhere for cheaper rents, bigger spaces, and less traffic. One downside of remote work is less face-to-face interaction. Our conversations are happening on screens, and though we can see each other’s faces, the experience just isn’t the same. As a result, emotional connection has never been more important. But making that connection requires different strategies for recruitment and retention. For recruitment, emotional connection means HR teams need to be more available for job candidates. They’ll need to reach them in new ways that may have seemed uncomfortable or unprofessional in the past. Think beyond LinkedIn and job sites and try social media, where candidates will have their guard down and engage in more natural dialogue. Emotional connection also means screening and interviewing candidates on video, instead of phone calls, and chatting with them through texts and different AI tools. Virtual recruitment will require HR leaders to dig deeper to keep candidates in the loop and understand who they really are. With retention, emotional connection is all about making sure employees feel valued, and there are several ways to do this. This means the leadership basics: setting clear priorities, communicating effectively, and being flexible. But it requires new ideas, too. For instance, cross-functional teams could be helpful in getting employees from different groups to work together. Or you could rethink your policies to ensure remote workers’ new needs are being addressed. Going even further, you could provide psychological or financial support for team members. Ultimately, it’s about doing a little more and being more creative to protect your talent. They may not be right in front of you, but you can still make them feel seen. Motivating a mobile workforce and motivating an in-person team are two different animals. Technology plays a huge role. In a 2016 survey,   said they were likely to leave a company because of old, slow tech. Even employees from other age groups said it was important, though not to the same degree. These results drive home the fact that keeping mobile workers happy requires different things, and today’s basics aren’t so, well...basic. Employees need to communicate, and when they do, it needs to be seamless and functional. Anything less and they can’t get their work done, which frustrates them and the people working alongside them. This means they need the best technology, and that technology has to be reliable. It’s the company’s responsibility to identify the right tools and ensure everyone has access. Cloud-based tools make sure everyone is literally on the same page. Remote desktops give everyone access to documents that may have been stored on their physical office computers. They can also give employees access to their home computers when they’re away. Real-time communication apps, video conferencing apps, and project management apps keep employees in the know and let them share instant updates. They can skip all the emails and meetings and still get stuff done. Furthermore, a cloud-based phone system lets team members take calls and check messages from any place at any time with a secure connection. Everyone may be working from different locations, but it doesn’t have to feel that way. Great tech helps teams deliver results from anywhere.\xa0 No, BYOD has nothing to do with what you should bring to the next dinner party you attend. It’s short for  , meaning that employees can use their own devices for work tasks instead of depending on equipment from the company. There are lots of upsides:  , they invest less time in training employees to use their tech, and it’s much easier to integrate new systems. But the shift to BYOD means businesses need to invest heavily in cybersecurity to keep tight wraps on sensitive information. Still, BYOD helps companies transition to remote ops without having to spend thousands on new laptops, software, or tutorials. Great communication didn’t just become important this year, but it has taken on new meaning in the era of remote work. When you tell employees about big internal changes and new developments, they feel valued, and they understand what’s going on in the company. Plus, effective communication keeps everyone working toward the right goals and priorities. But it’s not just about the bosses talking AT their employees – it’s a two-way street. Encourage your employees to ask for help when they need it and make sure they establish boundaries. Some communication   include using status updates on chat apps to let team members know when they’re available and setting personal working hours so that they have designated time for deep work or non-work tasks. Remote workers need balance. They’re working and living (and doing so many other activities) in the same space, and they no longer have clear signals that the workday is over. They aren’t punching out on a timeclock or driving home from the office. And they’re working longer days by an  . “Disconnect” days are days when employees take time to recharge. They’re unavailable for video calls, chats, and emails. Instead, they work on their own projects, or maybe nothing at all. You’ll need to figure out what this looks like for your team (e.g., how often, full days, half days, etc.). But whatever you decide, it’s important to recognize the power of personal time and rejuvenation. To help your team out with balance, you can also suggest best practices like establishing “end of day” rituals and maintaining a consistent schedule.  is an art, plain and simple. It takes more focus and innovation than managing a team in the office. There aren’t any more coffee chats at the local Starbucks, and employees can’t pop into your office to pick your brain. Some leaders might like this (finally, no more distractions), but it gives you less opportunities to read body language and pick up on important cues. For instance, companies have the rule that video must be turned on for all meetings. It makes such a big difference to see the people you are speaking with while the work is getting done. Working remotely means less chances for small talk about the weather and that TV show you’re binging on Netflix. Now, almost all of the time that you spend with your employees is about official business. And that’s just no fun. In fact, it can feel cold and demotivating. Maintaining personal connections can help you avoid this and make your team feel like you care about their well-being and not just their performance. Teams might be out of sight, but they can’t be out of mind. To grow any business, you have to grow your employees, too. But the mobile workforce can feel disconnected from company culture. Because of this, they have fewer chances to network and get face time with management. Leaders need to think ahead to fix this. This means regularly sharing news about growth opportunities and promotions, scheduling digital face time between managers and their reports, maintaining a check-in schedule where managers discuss individual performance successes and shortcomings, and investing in continued training. Keeping teams engaged requires you to do big and small things to show support and celebrate your people. You can start by communicating clearly and often, leading by example, and avoiding micromanagement. But you can do more. Seek feedback from the team and respond to it meaningfully and keep your interactions professional and friendly. Also, don’t forget about your culture of rewards and recognition. If you don’t already have one or you’ve fallen behind, this is the time to make it happen. The right rewards will be different for every company, but some common perks include new technology, home services (e.g. at-home cleaners), workspace upgrades, fitness club discounts, paid tuition for reskilling classes, boxes of healthy treats, and recognition or callouts during meetings. We’ve covered how important good communication is when dealing with teams that are spread out. But there are some helpful tips that you can use to make sure everyone gets the message every time. Schedule regular meetings and check-ins, so team members know when to expect feedback and connect with leadership. Good communication rhythm helps bring order to the WFH environment where the days feel like they all run together. When you assign work, set clear deadlines and expectations. Going further, consider writing company-wide communication guidelines so everyone is sticking to the same standards. Lastly, make sure all communication is timely, open, and honest. Transparency breeds trust, trust leads to better engagement, and engaged teams produce. Get ready to adapt. Business will keep changing, employees’ lives and home offices will change, and you’ll need to change how and when you communicate to meet these challenges. The mobile workforce will keep growing for years to come. This is the time for companies to get the right policies and technology in place to guarantee success. From the newest technology to clear messaging, there’s plenty that leaders can do to get their teams and their businesses ready. Work as we knew it is over – no more huge teams gathered together in conference rooms and in massive HQs. Instead, we all need to flex our creative muscles, keep open minds, and embrace remote work. This is the new normal, and accepting it is the only way to win. ', 'Interested in building your career working remotely? Here’s what you need to know. If you’ve read news about the future of work, you may notice that remote work is a frequent topic of discussion. The fundamental principle of remote work is that people do not need to be in the same location in order for work to be done. While remote work exists in a variety of shapes and sizes, it seems that this trend will continue to grow in the future, so let’s dig in and learn more about it. Remote work is  . In fact, U.S. Census data indicates that 5.2% of Americans now work remotely in some capacity,   just a decade ago. The rise of remote work is caused by a  , like rising housing costs in major metropolitan areas, a competitive hiring environment, globalization, and technological advancements. With this in mind, we can anticipate this trend to continue, especially considering remote work is   a company can offer. With this trend on the rise, if someone wants to work remotely, you might wonder how they can go about getting a remote job. Many of the articles online are focused on digital nomads, which is a bit different as these people are always travelling to new locations and many of them are contractors. There is a lack of resources online for people who would like to work full-time for a fully or partially distributed company. This post is not about traveling the world and contracting, but instead it’s about building a long-term career as a distributed worker. With that out of the way, let’s jump into how you might be able to get hired for a remote job and hang your hat as a professional distributed worker.\xa0 The first thing we need to do is identify the set of skills that separates a high-performing remote worker from the rest. There are a few critical skills you need to learn to land a job working remotely. As a distributed worker, you will have fewer meetings and in-person conversations, instead relying on written text to get things done. Many conversations with co-workers happen asynchronously over Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email. In the office, many of these conversations may have taken place in a meeting. Therefore, it’s critical that you learn how to communicate effectively over writing. Additionally, you should have a working knowledge of what communication channel is appropriate for a particular conversation. One should consider researching   as a starting point to help you choose the right communication channel for your message. For example, when collaborating with coworkers on an ambiguous project, should that happen over a chat tool or a video call? If you are a manager giving feedback to an employee, should that happen over email or elsewhere? As a remote worker, you need to know when to “switch” from one channel to another. The next skill-set you need to develop is becoming more proactive. While there are a variety of ways to improve in this category, here are two specific tips below.\xa0 The first way to be proactive is by sharing what you are doing on a regular basis. This information can be shared with your boss, the rest of the team, and other stakeholders. The key lesson is that people should never wonder what you are working on. As a remote worker, there are times when your boss may wonder what exactly you do on a daily basis. You can eliminate this potential concern by proactively sharing information instead. For example, you could send an update to your boss where you document what you accomplished during the week and lay out your priorities for the next week. Another way to be more proactive at work is to actively look for projects and opportunities to improve the business outside of your normal day-to-day activities. In a business, there’s never a shortage of work that needs to be done, but there is a shortage of people willing to uncover and do the work. In order to discover these opportunities, you need to hunt around for the opportunity, whether it’s meeting coworkers in another department and learning more about how they work, or spending some time investigating key business KPIs. If you work in an office and are not doing this now, it will be much tougher to do this as a remote worker as the information doesn’t flow as easily as a co-located environment. Another way to establish yourself as a potential remote candidate is by having experience working with a distributed team. A question an interviewer will ask is, “have you done this before?” On one hand, previous remote work experience is helpful, but if you don’t have full-time experience, it may not be an issue as long as you have tangible evidence and experience doing similar activities. For example, you could point to a side project, consulting, or another example where you have collaborated with other people on a project where you were in different locations. This is the crux of remote work. For example, you may have to work on a side project with a team that is located thousands of miles away. This will force you to learn how to document and communicate effectively in a remote environment, which is an important skill set when working remotely. It cannot be stressed enough how important these foundational components are. With that said, let’s talk specifically about tactics and ways you can get hired in a remote role. If you are looking for a remote job, there’s a variety of job boards that post remote positions, like We Work Remotely, Remotely Awesome Jobs, Angellist, and others. Fortunately, over the past few years, more traditional job search engines like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Google Jobs have made it easy to find remote-friendly job postings. If you see a job posting on these boards that you like, you should apply, but you also need to understand that there may be   of other applications, which means there’s a lot of competition. You need to stand out from the rest. There are three areas to focus your attention.\xa0 While you should feel compelled to shoot for the stars, you also need to be realistic. That said, only apply for the jobs where you are a close fit.\xa0 One secret is that many companies hire primarily via referrals from existing employees. Do you know someone who works at the company? Do you know someone who knows someone who works at the company? This can give you an advantage. Expand your network to see what opportunities might arise.\xa0 As a job seeker, you need to proactively connect the dots between your application and the position they are hiring for. If a potential employer views your resume, they shouldn’t have to work to understand how your skills apply to the job at hand. As Steve Krug might say,  The more of these boxes you check, the more likely you are to be hired remotely. The final piece of advice for getting a remote job is to get creative and don’t overlook your current employer. Many people are able to work remotely because they mustered up the courage to ask their boss if they could. Many people are too nervous to have the conversation. If you do great work, your boss may be willing to jump through hoops to keep you, even if you need to live somewhere else. If you have a good relationship with your manager, you should at least have the conversation. They may say no, but they may say yes. Give it a shot.\xa0 A major advantage to this approach is that your employer has already developed a baseline expectation of your work output. If you start working remotely and your output remains constant (or improves) when working remotely, it shouldn’t be a tough sell to convince your boss to continue this way of working.\xa0 In scenarios where your boss may be on the fence about remote work, ask if you could do a trial period. Instead of working five days/week away from the office, consider requesting if you can work two days a week from home. In the beginning, avoid asking to work from home on Fridays or Mondays; you need to send a signal that you are serious and won’t slack off. This approach can help you remove any perceived risk for your boss before transitioning to being fully-remote.\xa0 Remote work will continue to grow in popularity, so if you’d like an opportunity to participate, start developing key skills, connections, and make sure to explore the possibility with your current employer.\xa0 '], 26: ["Modern world functions on the pillars of wireless devices. They’re so common that you don’t even notice them as unique. You have mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices exchanging a lot of data with the internet. They’ve become a part of your daily life and an integral necessity. When you use these devices daily, you should keep them safe from threat actors. A network security key or Wi-Fi password is one such element that helps you ensure security around your devices. Simply put, a network security key is commonly known as the wireless network (or Wi-Fi) password. It’s a digital signature that prevents unauthorized people from accessing your network and allows you to maintain a secure connection between users requesting access to the network. It protects a network and the associated devices from unwanted access, empowering you to evade or information theft risks.\xa0 You can set a network security key using uppercase, lowercase, and special characters joined by a number. Make sure it doesn’t contain predictable elements like your name or the name of your loved one(s), a number related to your birthdate, or any combination that’s easy to guess.\xa0 Some of the common types of network security keys used for authorization in a wireless network are   and  . Different types of network security keys have distinct security offerings, yet their primary function remains the same, i.e., regulating access to wireless networks.  is a security algorithm intended to provide data confidentiality the same as traditional wired networks. It encrypts data packets using a 40-bit key combined with a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) to make an RC4 key. The 40 bit and 24 bit IV combine to create a 64-bit WEP key. WEP is a sequence of characters between numbers 0-9 and the letters A-F. So, your WEP key can be  Due to the U.S. restrictions on the export of several cryptographic technologies, early WEP versions were limited to 64-bit encryption devices. When the lifted these restrictions, 128-bit and 256-bit encryption also came into the picture. Out of these, 128-bit encryption was seen as the most common implementation in devices. The process looked secure, but in reality, anyone could decode the key by cracking the challenge-frames. To protect the network security key from potential exposure, Wi-Fi protected access superseded wired equivalent privacy and evolved as a more secure authentication method in wireless networks. In the Wi-Fi protected access (WPA) security algorithm, the client requesting to connect to a network needs a security key to initiate communication. After verification of the key, data exchanges are carried out in an encrypted manner. There are three versions of WPA: The wireless protected access security certification program protects data against modification risks using the message integrity check. It supersedes the cyclic redundancy check for error detection and correction, earlier used in WEP. It does have a  , which guards the data against viruses that can automatically modify and retransmit the packets. Thus, it replaces the cyclic redundancy check for error detection and correction used by the WEP. You can find a network security key in different ways, depending on the type of device where you’re searching for it. A network security key is often labeled on the exterior of a router. You should look for a small sticker at the back or the bottom of the device. If it’s not available there, check its packaging box or the manual that came with it from the manufacturer. On a router, the network security key would be labeled as a security key, WPA key, or passphrase. There would be a default one that came with the new device, but you need to change it to avoid unauthorized access.\xa0 When your Windows device is connected to the wireless network, you can access the saved login data to get the network security key. \xa0 For   users, you can use the following steps to find the passphrase of your network: If you’re using a   operating system, you can access the network security key through the following path: It’ll display the network security key you’re searching for. You can also use the same key to connect other devices to the network. When it comes to Mac, the process of finding your network’s password is somewhat similar to Windows. You should know the\xa0 Wi-Fi network's name, and you can instantly get the security key. Follow these six steps to find your network security key: Whether you have an Android or an iOS device, you can find the network security key stored on your phone in a few simple steps.\xa0 Android users with root access can use ES file explorer or Android terminal emulator, whereas users without root access can utilize Minimal ABD and Fastboot to get network security key. Finding a network security key on your iPhone or iPad is much easier than Android, as it doesn’t require root access. You can follow the steps mentioned below to access the network security key. Although the WPA2 security algorithm offers advanced security, you must keep the network security key safe from malicious hackers.

", "There are things you don’t mind sharing, like your favorite leather jacket or your fries with dinner. However, there are things that need to stay private, like your Social Security number or your credit card information. When it comes to   threats, one of the most common to occur is identity theft. In fact, there’s a new victim of identity theft  . If you have been unsure that you're doing everything you can to protect yourself, and your data, from stolen identity, keep reading to see what the experts had to say about ensuring your personal information stays out of the wrong hands. Before you can protect your identity from being stolen, let’s explain exactly what identity theft is. Let’s break down the nine things experts recommend you do to prevent identity theft. “There are a number of ways to protect identity theft, but the easiest way is to use  . Password managers scan your passwords for anything that is weak, old, or repeated, generating long and complicated replacements. You can also set up two or even   using  , like a fingerprint or   for added security. I recommend getting a password manager with a dark web scan and an email scan.” “I use Credit Freezes and LifeLock to protect from identity theft. I also never throw away documents with bank account numbers or any other sensitive information. I make sure to shred them instead! Identity thieves could go through your trash and find out important information in order to steal your identity.” “One of the ways I protect myself from identity theft is by getting a credit report from all 3 bureaus every year. They are required to give one free report per year, and I go through each of them meticulously for information that is incorrect. I also use an identity monitoring service, which is invaluable for catching problems early. This monitors my credit report and alerts me when any changes or requests are made. It also monitors the dark web for my social security number, credit card numbers, health insurance numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses. The final step I take for credit protection is credit freezes. I have frozen my credit at all three major credit bureaus. This means I can't open a credit card or get a loan at a moment's notice, but neither can anyone else pretending to be me.” “The best thing to do right now is close off any and all social media accounts. This is probably nearly impossible for most people. So, the next logical step is reviewing your privacy and security settings so that your private information (birthday, other significant dates, pictures, information about family and friends, etc.) stays private and out of the wrong hands.” “The best way to ensure your data and the messages you send through apps are secure is to make sure every app you use has end-to-end encryption. Encryption will mask all data, protecting it from unauthorized access. And, since many enterprises use social media accounts or   for access, relying on biometric technology that authenticates a user through facial recognition and liveness detection can be incredibly useful to secure your data.” “I'm quite paranoid about identity theft, so I have implemented a few different strategies to prevent it. For instance, I try to prevent uploading anything too sensitive to   like Dropbox. That’s easier said than done, so to add an extra layer of security I encrypt everything locally first with a program called Cryptomator. This means you encrypt files in a vault and then move that vault into Dropbox. It's essentially double encryption but you hold the encryption key for Cryptomator rather than Dropbox, which has the key and all that is required is a password to decrypt it.” “When it comes to preventing identity theft, think about the information you share with people online. The less personal information people post online, the less likely it can be used against them. Also, users need to talk to their friends and family to ensure they help maintain privacy as well. Many common security questions are based upon information that could be gathered from information posted online by users and their connections.” “The majority of customers are still unfortunately extremely careless about their passwords - they reuse passwords across platforms or set very weak passwords, like myname1234. This means if one platform where you used your password is compromised, the combination of email and password gets known to the hackers, it is published often on the dark web, and all other platforms with the same combination get exposed. Because of this, it’s more important than ever to know  .” “Don't click on links or download attachments from emails or text messages unless you have confirmed they are legitimate. This is how hackers send   emails that contain  . This often includes keystroke logging malware which will harvest your personal information is delivered.” Save yourself the time, energy, and money by implementing these identity theft prevention tips before your personal data falls into the wrong hands. Identity theft can happen to anyone as there are many ways for hackers to access your information. Take the necessary steps and implement these tips to ensure it doesn’t happen to you.

", "A lot can happen between a login and a logout. Attackers look for sessions where they can gain unauthorized access to your accounts and exploit your data. You should ensure that you authenticate your login details in a secure environment and protect yourself against session hijacking attacks. You can use to detect anomalies in the incoming traffic and block potentially malicious traffic as it comes. But to fix robust security defenses, it’s crucial to understand session hijacking in detail, its types, and the tools that attackers might use to penetrate user accounts. , also known as cookie hijacking, is a process of taking control of a user’s session by obtaining or generating a session ID while the session is still in progress.\xa0 An attacker could use cross-site scripting (XSS), \xa0 , reverse engineering, or various other methods to get their hands on session cookies and gain unauthorized access to user accounts. A session starts when you log into a service such as a web application and ends when you log out. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless protocol, which means it carries each request independently without referring to any previous request, requiring a user to authenticate every time they view a web page. To avoid prompting a user to log in every time, the server assigns a session ID to provide a seamless web experience after authentication.\xa0 Attackers try to steal the target’s session ID or trick them into   that takes them to a prefabricated session for a session hijacking attack. Once the user is authenticated on the server, threat actors can hijack the session and trick the server into considering their session valid.\xa0 When an attacker targets a session cookie, it’s related to web application session hijacking, not Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) session hijacking.   is a transport protocol that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets. Web application returns a session cookie after successful authentication that an attacker exploits to hijack a session. It has nothing to do with the TCP connection between the user’s device and the server. Attackers usually have a few methods of choice while performing a session hijack. They can either use them individually or in a combination to take over user accounts and carry malicious activities. In a   attack, a malicious hacker tricks the target’s computer into executing a code that masquerades as trusted code belonging to a server. It allows an attacker to get a copy of the cookie to perform their malicious actions. Typically, web pages are embedded with JavaScript. Without proper safeguards and , it reveals users’ sensitive information if the scripts are executed. If the server doesn’t set the   attribute in session cookies, scripts can expose them to attackers.\xa0 Some or trojans are programmed to steal browser cookies and perform malicious actions without a user’s knowledge. For example, when a user visits a malicious website or clicks an unsolicited link, the malware scans the network traffic, collects session cookies, and sends them to bad actors. Attackers with access to local storage can steal session keys from the browser’s temporary local storage (cookie jar), or they can obtain file or memory contents of either the server or the user’s computer. Attackers can perform a  to guess a user’s session key. When an application uses a sequential or predictable session key, it makes the session vulnerable to a hijack. This was a preferred method of choice in the past, but with modern applications, session IDs are long and randomly generated, offering substantial resistance to brute force attacks.\xa0 In  , an attacker leverages packet sniffing to read network traffic and steal the session cookie. Typically, websites use Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) encryption in their authentication pages. Still, some don’t use it site-wide after authentication, enabling attackers to intercept data exchanged between the server and the web pages.\xa0 Once attackers get their hands on session cookies, they can hijack users’ sessions to conduct malicious operations. For example, a bad actor targeting a user connected to an unsecured WiFi can easily read the data or traffic shared between other nodes and access points. Attackers can sometimes create a disguised session and trick a user into authenticating to a vulnerable server. For example, a threat actor could use (phishing) or a similar method to persuade a user to click on a link that takes them to a crafted session with a known session cookie. Once the user authenticates, the attacker can use the known session key to hijack the user’s session. An attacker can also trick users into completing a pre-fabricated login form that includes a hidden and fixed session ID. There are two levels of session hijacking attacks. These attacks can be interrelated as a successful attack on a network layer will give the attacker information to exploit an actual user at the application level. Transport layer hijacking occurs in TCP connections where an attacker intercepts data exchanges between a web server and a user, debarring the communication channel set between them. Then, bad actors send malicious data packets disguised as legitimate ones to both client and server, taking over the user session.\xa0 A common method of transport layer hijacking is  , where an attacker uses a falsified IP address disguised as a trusted one to communicate with the computers on the network. They use source-routed IP packets to intercept active communication between two nodes. IP spoofing takes undue advantage of one-time authentication at the start of the TCP session.\xa0 \xa0In application layer hijacking, an attacker steals a user's session ID after a user authenticates to their application.   are typical examples of application layer session hijacking, where the hijacker intercepts the communication channel between the client and the server. Proxy attacks also fall under application layer hijacking. An attacker directs the traffic to a proxy server with a predefined session ID to intercept the communication during these attacks. Session hijacking involves guessing or intercepting session cookies in an existing session or tricking a user to authenticate in a prefabricated session. There are three types of session hijacking attacks. In  , an attacker takes over an active connection in a network. They can mute all devices and take over the communication channel between the client and the server. Then, they let go of the affiliation between the server and the user’s device. There are a few ways by which an attacker can interrupt communication between a client and a server. Typically, intruders send massive traffic to attack a valid session and cause a   attack.  is similar to active, except that an attacker monitors the communication between a client and a server. The attacker doesn’t block the actual user out of the session but supervises the ongoing communication exchange. The primary motive of passive attacks is to steal exchanged information and use it for malicious purposes.  are a combination of active and passive attacks. In a hybrid attack, attackers monitor the network traffic until they find an issue, then take over the session and start impersonating legitimate users. The primary difference between session hijacking and session spoofing is the attack’s timing.  attacks are conducted once users authenticate themselves into the application. The attack may lead to lags or uncommon behavior in applications. It’s because an attacker exploits your data while you’re still logged in. If an application is frequently crashing, it might suggest a session hijacking attack. In  , victims aren’t aware of the attack. Attackers might use stolen or counterfeit session IDs and impersonate genuine users without relying on a user to perform authentication. A session replay is a bit different.\xa0 In  , attackers already have session cookies (collected from session hijacking), and they can use them however they want. They might trick a victim into re-submitting a previously valid request, such as buying multiple quantities of items where they originally requested for one unit. Several tools can help an attacker conduct a session hijacking attack. You can use them in and check if your systems and applications are attack-proof. Here are some of the popular session hijacking tools used to carry out an attack. Hamster acts like a proxy server that manipulates data collected by Ferret, which captures session cookies that pass the network.  was initially developed as a network monitoring tool to run on the Windows platform. However, while monitoring a network, one can hijack a session as all communication across the network is copied in real-time, providing a precise data transmission output. Because of this, Engrade, the developer of T-Sight, now provides software licenses to only pre-determined IP addresses.  is a network sniffing tool that can be maliciously used to conduct a session hijacking attack. It’s possible to configure Juggernaut to watch all network traffic in a   or listen to a particular session token. It can be set to record network traffic after a victim makes a login attempt.\xa0 Juggernaut is different from regular network sniffers that record all network traffic in huge log files. Juggernaut maintains a connection database that allows an attacker to watch all TCP-based connections and even hijack a session. The session hijacking tool also provides a built-in function of packet assembly. Attackers use this functionality to fragment packets to evade intrusion detection systems and firewalls. These were some of the tools that attackers use to conduct session hijacking attacks.\xa0 You need to strengthen your networks and systems against similar tools like Hunt, TTY-Watcher, IP-Watcher, 1164, Wireshark, SSHMITM, Hjksuite, C2MYAZZ, which attackers use to exploit user sessions. Session hijacking can have dire consequences for organizations, including financial losses and reputational losses incurred after years of building a good reputation and providing faithful service in the industry.\xa0 Businesses need to set strategic security measures to avoid becoming targets of session hijacking attacks. These measures include: Having site-wide HTTPS is arguably the most important preventive mechanism. If you’re worried about performance issues, you can implement SSL on the website’s login pages and in other sensitive areas. Another important preventive measure would be to encrypt the session value stored in a session cookie. Session hijacking can be troublesome. Be proactive and set a proper defense mechanism to protect yourself from session hijacking attacks and to protect your account and data. With hackers consistently developing new methods to crack an organization’s defense perimeters, it might get even trickier to ensure 100% security.

"], 36: ["While communicating with external clients or vendors may seem like a priority for businesses, internal communication is just as important as it increases team productivity\xa0and keeps everybody within the organization on the same page. Scheduling, reiterating goals and all other internal messages rely on the use of communication channels. Whether it be to collaborate on a project or to alert the office that the milk is spoiled, these channels of   are in constant use. Some communication channels are often overlooked. Not many people consider leaning over to your office mate to ask what time a meeting starts or leaving a note that the dishwasher is clean as using a communication channel. But it is! Any time information is exchanged between people, a type of communication channel is used. Period.  is an efficient outlet for both formal and informal messages. Whether it be an email that contains essential information about a new client, or a flier posted in the lunch room about a coworker’s birthday party, the message finds its way to the intended audience. Here are some examples of written communication channels and when to use them. The range of uses for email communication is broad. They can be used to schedule a meeting, share a file, or contact someone who is typically hard to reach over the phone, such as a client in a different time zone. The spectrum of formality in emails is also large. Sending an email to a colleague you connect with multiple times a day might be short, sweet and informal. On the other hand, reaching out to your boss to set up salary negotiations might take on a more formal tone. Email is convenient, but be careful with it. When using this communication channel, make sure the topic is appropriate to discuss online. Some topics, such as hiring or firing decisions, might be better to discuss in person. There are a lot of different ways to communicate, but no matter which one you use, use these etiquette tips to be heard -- without being offensive. Memos act as a “Heads up!” or “Don’t forget!” kind of message that addresses an entire group. Replying is not necessary, but recipients still have the ability to ask questions. Memos come in handy if a new policy or procedure is instated and the whole office is affected. They can be sent electronically or printed and posted in a communal area as daily reminders. Coworkers can use instant messaging software for immediate communication. Less formal than an email, these messages usually get right to the point and do not include a formal greeting or salutation. Users can create groups based on topics, share files, and pin important pieces of a conversation to refer back to at a later time. The use of gifs and emojis leaves room for this type of communication channel to be fun, animated and informal.\xa0 Arguably the best thing about written communication channels is they can be referred back to when needed and the information is still directly from the source. So if the title of that new client slips your mind or if you can’t remember the time the birthday soiree starts, don’t fret! Pull up that email from your inbox or stroll on over to the lunch room to take a second look. Oral communication channels are the most effective way to have a two-sided conversation. If feedback, questions and clarifications are inevitable, oral, or sometimes called  , might be the best bet. Here are a couple of different types of oral communication channels. Meeting in person will never go out of style.  ,\xa0like gestures and body language, are best understood while meeting face to face. In-person meetings are good for discussing sensitive topics that will result in a two-way conversation. Communicating with a colleague over the phone is another effective oral communication channel. While gestures and facial expressions cannot be seen, the intended tone can still be easily recognized. An effective phone conversation can be as quick as answering the phone, responding to or answering a question, and hanging up. Thanks to the Internet and communication technology, people no longer have to be physically together to have a similar experience as a face to face meeting.   allows multiple users to “attend a meeting.” The topics discussed over this software can be the same as ones talked about in person. It just provides users with another option if being in the same place at the same time isn’t possible. Oral communication channels provide coworkers with a personal touch that can’t be felt when messages are written. Technology may be convenient, but nothing beats interacting with a smiling face or a friendly voice! The use of effective communication channels is crucial to the success of a business. Once your business' written and oral channel skills are mastered, your internal communications should be going steady. \xa0 ", "This is not an exhaustive list, but it gives a great overview of how our communication pattern looks. Now take a moment, and look at the contrarian nature of some of the tools that you use.\xa0 , phone calls, and video calls are examples of synchronous communication tools. Communication has to be done on an instant basis. When you’re having an synchronous conversation, you’re present in real-time to carry on the communication. On the other hand, there are tools like email software,  , chat software, and project management tools. When you use these tools, you have the choice of replying to someone at your preferred time. Like a chat, you can reply to it instantly or later. All of these tools are asynchronous tools, and when you use them to interact with others, you’re indulging in asynchronous communication. In this blog, we will talk about asynchronous communication in detail. What are its benefits and drawbacks, why do companies rely on them, and what are the most common asynchronous communication tools used in workplaces.  is a conversation not done in real time. When two or more people exchange information without expecting to get an immediate reply, they’re said to be conversing in an asynchronous manner. When you participate in asynchronous communication, you have the choice of deciding when you want to reply to the text or chat message you have just received from your friend, colleague or family member.\xa0 o frequently, a major amount of your time gets spent on just communicating with others.\xa0 This is only the basic detail of asynchronous communication.Now let's move deeper into understanding the differences between synchronous and asynchronous communication. To get a more holistic view, here’s a detailed comparison table showing the differences between synchrono Knowing the definition and the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication is a great way of building an understanding of this subject. In this part of the blog, we will take a step further, and find out why companies are relying on asynchronous communication and including it in their work culture. Fewer interruptions = higher productivity. Asynchronous communication allows employees to work on a task for a longer period. Since the communication is not done in real-time, there is no need to hop into a call or a meeting in between. Automatically, it helps them to get more things done at a specific time. As companies are obsessing over productivity, asynchronous communication tools have become a natural choice for them. Well-connected teams can increase productivity by . By developing an asynchronous work culture, companies can expect to strengthen the connectivity between these teams. Asynchronous communication has a more empathetic approach to teamwork. Instead of scheduling video meetings and phone calls every hour, by using asynchronous tools, at least a few communication tasks can be delayed. This will give team members more time to gather their thoughts, and think more deeply. In the long run, this will encourage employees to collaborate more effectively. When you let your employees concentrate on their work, and establish firm ground for thoughtful communication with their peers, it builds an overall positive relationship within the company. It creates a fine balance between achieving personal deadlines and contributing to teamwork with an open communication atmosphere. It also helps in retaining employees, as   of them tend to reject other job offers when they have a close relationship with their teammates at the workplace.\xa0 If you work with people from different geographical locations and diverse time zones, then asynchronous communication has the upper hand when it comes to communication. Due to time limitations, you cannot expect all your team members to be available for a synchronous call every time. Asynchronous communication is more helpful for interacting with your team. You can use the time lag to your advantage by being more mindful about what you say, and use it as an opportunity to construct deeper relationships with remote teams. Therefore, an asynchronous communication tool is a must-have in the list of  . Many asynchronous communication tools depend on written communication. This sounds like extra work because talking is more spontaneous and easy as compared to thoughtful writing. However, it has a silver lining. With asynchronous communication, you can keep track of the communication. You can always go back, refer to previous communication, and draw new insights. This gets more important when you use asynchronous communication for interacting with customers. It helps in dispute resolution and acts as a knowledge base for the teams A few companies are reaping the benefits of using asynchronous communication in their workplace. A few will transition to   in the coming times, and adopt asynchronous tools. As an employee, what are the benefits you can expect from this form of communication? Find out in this section of the blog. Synchronous communication can get stressful if done too frequently. Imagine attending back-to-back video meetings with multiple members. You have to switch attention between different speakers, stay attentive all the time, and speak up when it’s your turn. This combination can become overwhelming and ultimately lead to problems like  whereas asynchronous communication keeps you miles away from this kind of stress. When you have the power to decide what and when you want to communicate, you have better control over your communication and mental balance.\xa0 Not everyone is comfortable participating in live online calls. Even the thought of it can be a traumatic experience for someone having social anxiety. The nervousness arises from the fear of being judged or compared with others. In such a case, synchronous calls can be counterproductive for the team.\xa0 With asynchronous communication, employees can easily let go of this feeling. There is no pressure on them as to how they sound or look. Moreover, they don’t have to suffer from palpitations when someone asks them for their opinions or thoughts. They can construct it in their own time and share it with others.  of employees prefer flexibility in their jobs. It makes their job more attractive to them. This is understandable because a lot of employees give higher importance to their work-life balance. Remote working provides flexibility to an extent. But if the communication is mostly synchronous, it doesn’t stay that way for a long time. Their productive hours are taken by calls and meetings.\xa0 By using more asynchronous methods of communication employees can plan their work schedule more effectively. They can not only decide the work schedule but also when they want to communicate with others. They get more freedom to do their job at the best time without interruptions, and schedule replying to chats and emails later during the day.  means getting into a productive zone where you work for an extended period without distraction. For remote teams, deep work is very important for producing effective results. This can be achieved with asynchronous communication. By limiting the number of synchronous calls, employees can get into a flow and tunnel their vision on completing the task.\xa0 If you have read the blog till here, there’s one thing that you must have realized already: asynchronous communication helps you have more control over your schedule. By schedule, it means both work and communication.\xa0 This is important for employees as they get their job done, communicate thoughtfully with their peers, have better mental satisfaction, and are a lot happier. It’s also good for companies as they don’t have to worry about lower employee turnover rates, and spend extra dollars on hiring new talent every time. This is one of those off-beat examples where higher control leads to more results. Asynchronous communication has many positives. It gives more freedom, encourages thoughtful communication, supports deep work, and helps to maintain a better work-life balance. However, it also has a few drawbacks which can come in the way of daily work. Here are the three major disadvantages of using asynchronous communication tools that you should be aware of. Asynchronous communication gives more time to reply to a conversation. But, while doing that it loses the personalization that synchronous communication offers. Live face-to-face interaction is limited which can have a negative impact on the employees. A longer duration without such interactions can make them feel left out. Personalization in communication is important for customers too.\xa0  agreed on spending more on a brand that provides personalized customer service. In such an instance, if you’re choosing emails over phone calls, you may end up losing customers. Moreover, there is always a risk of your written communication getting misunderstood which will add to your trouble In a competitive landscape, businesses thrive by taking quick actions. Usually, these actions are taken after having thorough discussions with the team. In a synchronous call, every team member can participate in real-time, put forward their ideas, and get things rolling. This is just not possible with asynchronous communication.\xa0 As people have the choice to interact with others at their own time, they may not participate instantly. This delays the process of taking action. Decisions get stuck in a communication limbo jeopardizing business gains. If you manage a business where actions have to be taken almost immediately, then using asynchronous communication for limited interactions will yield better returns for your business.\xa0 Similar to fast-footed actions, instant brainstorming doesn’t go well with asynchronous communication. Brainstorming sessions are important to develop a participative and collaborative environment within a company. Not all brainstorming meetings will have a concrete solution, but it encourages employees to share their ideas and views.\xa0 With synchronous calls, they can do it instantly, and get feedback too. They don’t have to wait for others to reply in their time. Brainstorming can be done with asynchronous tools, but the priority and expectation have to be set that way. The participants should be given clear instruction on how things work out in an asynchronous way, and what they should expect.\xa0 Let’s uncover the most common asynchronous tools used in workplaces and remote working environments.\xa0 With over   sent every second, it’s not too hard to relate to the working dynamics of email communication tools. Emails are asynchronous because once you send them, you do not expect an immediate response. It’s an acceptable norm for the receiver to reply at their own time.\xa0 Due to the ease of use, emails are a popular mode of communication within and outside the organization. Be it team discussions or customer support, emails do a great job of establishing clear communication. Project management is an essential part of daily working in a corporate and remote working environment alike. Using project management software, teams maintain a scrum or a kanban board to keep a track of activities. They communicate asynchronously by moving cards in different categories. The categories mostly reflect what tasks have been completed, how many are in progress, and how many have to be started. Teams also comment on each other’s cards and add team members as collaborators to interact on the progress. Project management software is a great example of how you can get things done without always getting on a synchronous call. Teams rely on  , also known as chats to share reviews, feedback, and updates that don’t require sending an email. Instant messages are usually shorter in length and more convenient for quick messaging. It saves time and can be more productive when there are many tasks lined up to be completed. Teams can create separate fun groups to have non-work discussions without interrupting their work schedule. Screen sharing software allows users to share their content on a laptop or computer screen with others asynchronously. They can also do webcam recording along with voice narration. Screen recorders are one of those very few tools that help to have video communication albeit in an asynchronous manner. It works very well for giving personal feedback, recording tutorial videos, embedding in welcome emails and video presentations too. With the increase in the number of remote workers, screen recorders surely have a bright future in the video communication space. Knowledge management software is a type of content management software used by companies and conglomerates to build a repository of information. The information usually consists of processes that can be accessed by everyone else in the company.\xa0 Anyone can contribute to knowledge management software on an ongoing basis. It’s an example of an asynchronous communication tool as it gives them the freedom to build an information system together at their own pace. Co-creators can also comment or update each other’s information thereby collaborating toward a common goal. Online forums are very popular for indulging employees and customers in the product growth journey of a company. Internet users like forums too, as   of them actively participate by reading and commenting in online forums and communities. It also has a strategic advantage for companies; when you build a community with stakeholders, they take a personal interest in the growth and trust you more.\xa0 In a forum, employees can post questions to get answers from their teammates. Similarly, customers can also post questions, feature requests, and updates on product development. Since the intention here is to inform rather than having a conversation, the discussions mostly remain asynchronous.\xa0 Surveys and polls are similar to online forums. The major difference is that surveys may not be ongoing. It’s conducted from time to time to understand customer feedback, product review, and market expectations. Similarly, it can also be done internally to know what the employees think about the company. Surveys can be done in a synchronous manner, like phone surveys. However, asynchronous surveys are more preferable as they’re less intimidating and give more time to think while sharing feedback. In an asynchronous survey, companies share a feedback form with pre-filled questions. Customers or employees can enter their thoughts when they feel like doing it. There is no undue pressure of answering immediately. Online digital whiteboards are  . Instead of scheduling a video or phone call to talk about new ideas or inspirations, digital whiteboards allow you to do that with the same effectiveness in an asynchronous way. It also gives more freedom to play around with the interface by customizing it as per your liking. You can create boards and add notes to share ideas. Brainstorming sounds more attractive when done over synchronous communication mediums. However, asynchronous tools like whiteboard software help to look at things visually which unlocks new possibilities. Executives feel that   of the meetings fail miserably in communicating the principal agenda of the meeting. That’s more than   meetings each day. The productivity loss is abysmal. Agendaless meetings are more hampering for remote teams as employees have a higher personal responsibility of getting things done.\xa0 To have more thoughtful and purposeful meetings, meeting management software is very helpful. You cannot just nullify synchronous meetings, but you can set a better agenda by using these tools. Meeting management software empowers team members to plan ahead what they want to discuss in the call. They can set agendas, timelines, and add documents to have focused collaboration. This way every team member is crystal clear on the meeting plan and approach, too. Remote working is a lot about owning responsibility and getting things done within the timeline. Therefore, it demands deep work and more flexibility in communication. Asynchronous communication offers both. Remote workers can focus on tasks on hand and schedule replying to messages later when they’re done. This eliminates stress and ensures a better work-life balance.\xa0 This is more applicable for remote teams that are distributed worldwide working in different time zones. With so many new remote workers joining the brigade, asynchronous communication will be in more demand, and highly preferred by remote teams. ", "Knowledge is power. That statement has never been more accurate than it is right now. The evolution and   tell us that we are currently in the Information Age, a time when wisdom is the key to success. The best way to pass wisdom along is through communication. Already familiar with the basics? Feel free to jump ahead: With strong communication, spreading knowledge is smooth like peanut butter. Or almond butter. Or cashew butter. Or whatever the kids are eating these days. Communication is constant. Even when our mouths are shut and our phones are locked, we are sending messages. Now that we have that definition in mind, let's dive into the details of how communication works, the different types of communication, and skills you need to be an effective communicator.\xa0 Because communication is such an effortless common occurrence, it is a strange thought that the process has more than one step. However, communication theory tells us something different.  is the scientific study of sending and receiving information. Under communication theory, there are different models that apply to different situations. It can get a little heavy, so I’ll break down the most important parts. The communication process typically includes four elements: sender, message, channel, and receiver. Not so complicated, right? We send information using\xa0 and then the message is received in one way or another. Well, unfortunately, it’s not that simple. A lot more needs to be considered. When communicating in a new circumstance, with a new person, or through a new channel, taking a step back and asking yourself these questions will ensure effective communication. Consider the parties involved in the communication. Their communication skills, attitudes, knowledge, and backgrounds might affect the way they deliver or interpret a message. Take a look at the information you are sharing. The content, structure, and elements paired with it can make or break the effectiveness of a message. This question takes into account both the message and the parties involved. Make sure the\xa0 channel you are using is appropriate for the\xa0communicators involved and the information being sent. Certain topics are best discussed in person, while others are perfectly fine being sent in an email. Also, some people might prefer a specific channel over another. Distractions, varying information, and unrelated facts can get in the way of a message’s purpose. Take those into account and find ways to make the message as clear as possible. All communication, whether we think about it or not, has a desired effect. It can be as simple as sharing information or as complicated as changing someone’s behavior. Recognize your message’s purpose and craft it to get your desired effect. Communication works in mysterious ways. Taking an extra minute to consider the individual components of a message will help you construct the best message for your current situation. Choosing the right channel is an important step in the communication process. But before you choose a channel, you must select the appropriate type of communication. Don’t worry, you have options. There are four main  : verbal, nonverbal, written and visual. Understanding the appropriate time and place for each is a necessary step in developing your communication skills.  is the use of speech to share information. Because it is the most personal way to communicate, learning effective verbal communication is crucial to the development and maintenance of all relationships. When communicating verbally, we need to consider two factors: word choice and tone. The words we choose should reflect the knowledge levels of the audience. Speak simply to people learning about a new topic, and save the jargon for talking with industry experts. Our tone, or attitude, is also dependent on the audience. We should be more formal when speaking with our boss than when we are joking around with friends. Thanks to  , communicating verbally can happen using methods other than talking in person, such as via telephone\xa0or with  . This channel is especially useful when someone is out of reach, but you still want the conversation to be as personal as possible.  is the way we send messages without speaking. No matter how thoughtless, our actions speak volumes. Understanding what certain actions imply is important when sending and receiving information. Our bodies include a lot of communication methods. Facial expressions, body language, and eye contact are good indicators of emotion, energy, and interest. Make sure your nonverbal cues show that you are  , engaged, and energetic, even if that isn’t really the case. Paying attention to nonverbal cues is important in understanding someone’s current state. If a person is slouching or yawning while speaking, it’s pretty obvious they don’t care so much about the information they are presenting. But when someone is making eye contact, sitting up straight, or nodding in agreement, they are sending a positive message about themselves.  is using the written word to share information. Because written communication channels are concrete, this is the best method for sharing large amounts of important information that will likely be revisited at a later time. Like verbal communication, word choice needs to be considered when sending a written message. Be aware of complicated industry terms and jargon. A common misconception of writing is that the more fancy words you use, the smarter you sound. The opposite is actually true. Writing that is simple and concise is the true sign of knowledge on a topic. Written communication channels have also advanced with the help of technology. Using a pen and paper to write a message will never go out of style. However, email and instant messengers have become common tools in personal and professional conversations.  is sending information in forms that can be seen. When communicating number-heavy materials or providing examples, pairing them with a form of visual communication can be beneficial to the receiver. Visual communication can take a few forms. Graphs, photographs, models, and objects all give message receivers a break from written or spoken words and provide them with another way to go about understanding something. Recognize when a visual would help your audience, and provide one when necessary. No matter the type of communication you use, your method will use one of these four  : passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, and assertive. However, only one of these styles will give you your desired effect. Let’s take a look at each one. Passive communication is used when people wish to come across as indifferent about the topic at hand. They support all opinions, no matter how they feel or how different the opinions are. The passive communication style is ineffective because when people don’t honestly voice their own opinions, the information is limited to the ideas of those that do. Aggressive communication is used when people overpower the conversation with their own thoughts and refuse to listen to the ideas of others. Being aggressive is not a good way to communicate. It intimidates others from sharing their own thoughts and defeats the purpose of a conversation, which is to share and discuss ideas. A passive-aggressive style is used when people come across as if they don’t care about something, but in a way that is indirectly angry and accusatory. This style of communication is also ineffective because it is dishonest. People who use this communication style don’t express the way they really feel and instead use ambiguous language, leaving other involved parties left to interpret a confusing message. Being assertive is the most effective way to communicate. With this style, people express their thoughts, ideas, and opinions while also respecting and listening to those of others. Assertive communication includes offering ideas, asking for feedback, and then actually listening to it. All ideas are expressed, heard, and respected. It can be easy to speak passively when shy, aggressively when angry, and passive-aggressively when feeling both. However, to be an effective communicator and have a worthwhile conversation, we must be assertive. Lacking communication skills is a common flaw. If you have this problem, making an effort to fix it is worth your while. Miscommunication can lead to a lot of problems. Avoid them with these communication tips! Listening is arguably the most important part of communication. If a message is sent and no attention is paid to it, the information is lost. Be attentive and take the speaker’s ideas into account before giving feedback. This shows that you have given them your full attention instead of just waiting for your turn to talk. Understanding your audience is key to crafting an effective message. To fully understand your message, some people might need background, explanations, and clarification. Get a feel for their current understanding of the topic you are presenting and adjust your delivery accordingly. Don’t forget about nonverbal communication. We are constantly communicating with our bodies, whether it is intentional or not. Focus on the nonverbal cues of a speaker to better understand their message, and make sure that your nonverbal cues match the message you are trying to send. If you are trying to excite coworkers about the company retreat while leaning back in your chair and crossing your arms, they won’t buy it. Actions speak louder than words. Give your written communication a second glance before presenting it. Read your message out loud or have a second pair of eyes read it over to help you pick up on typos or grammatical errors.\xa0 If you are feeling uneasy about how a message was sent or accepted, redeliver it. It’s better for a message to be received more than once than not received at all. Questions, comments, and clarifications are a natural part of the communication process. It welcomes new insights and ideas, strengthening the conversation. Taking feedback into consideration can also help you craft better messages in the future. Give your audience some important points to keep in mind. This will help them organize their thoughts while they are deciphering the bulk of the information. Towards the end of the message, reiterate those points so they walk away with them. Effective communication is necessary for all relationships. Whether you are managing employees or nurturing a companionship, there can be no growth without effective communication. With honest communication comes problem-solving, loyalty, and trust. \xa0 "], 41: ["Think about when you applied for your current job. How long did your interview process take? How long were you waiting by the phone, excitedly anticipating that call from HR but also nervous that all of your hard work may go to waste? And when you finally received that golden ticket of an offer, how long did it take until all of the introductions and induction rituals ended and you were actually productive at your job? Let me bring you back to reality: this whole process takes far too long and costs businesses far too much. As people in the HR and learning and development sectors, we spend so much time trying to find the right candidates and onboarding our new hires that we forget that we already have a superior talent pool hanging out around the water cooler. So how can we get the most out of our current employees?\xa0 Foster a culture of continuous learning and   so that we can accurately upskill and reskill our workforce. This way, when new positions are required, we can look inward to find the people best suited to the job.

In contrast, according to  , 95% of learning professionals say that it takes less than $10,000 to reskill someone for another job.\xa0 So why does all of this matter? We’ve compiled a complete rundown of the top reasons you need to start upskilling and reskilling your workforce and how to incorporate this into your 2020 learning strategy. When we took a little trip down memory lane at the beginning of this article, we only saw it from an employee’s perspective. But what about this same story from your company’s angle? How much did it cost them to find a suitable fit and then get them up and running? Businesses must always be conscious of the return on their investments (ROI) if they want to be profitable, but  , while the average tenure of a top candidate is 1.2 years, the average payback period (time until ROI) is 2.2 years. You don't have to be good at math to know that something doesn't quite add up.\xa0To mitigate this, concentrating on upskilling and reskilling your teams can drastically reduce your costs as you search within a pool of existing employees and accurately match their skills with the skills that the new role requires. On a similar note, if you offer clear career progression within your company, top talent is much more likely to be loyal to you. With millennials making up the majority of the workforce and   to them in a job, we have to start listening if we want to attract and keep hold of them. As the talent pool becomes more competitive, you have to offer something more than gym memberships and ping pong tables. By offering learning and development programs aimed at reskilling and upskilling, your top performers won't feel the need to go outside of your organization to gain more knowledge, and you get to leverage their growing expertise within your company. Everybody wins. Along with equipping your workforce with the skills they need to flourish, remember that a healthy soldier leads to a healthy army. If you have a squadron of agile, knowledgeable employees who are used to adapting to new skills and retraining on the job, you set your business up for success when new market changes present themselves.

As you plan for your strategic goals in 2020 and beyond, you can see where your teams may need more work, define where skills gaps are likely to present themselves, and actively work at preventing them. This preparation stops you from being taken by surprise and having to invest time and money into trying to catch up. As with all business-related strategies, your learning strategy should be fed by your business goals and objectives. Leveraging tools to analyze the skills and skills gaps of your employees will show you where you need to make changes and where upskilling and reskilling can be your best friend. Being aware of what your organization wants to achieve over the coming year sets you up perfectly for an upskilling and reskilling strategy, where you can tweak your employees’ skills to help you to reach these goals (while also helping them reach theirs!). Just as when you first started your job, it can take a while to align with the business and start earning your keep. So how can you avoid this period of unproductivity? You guessed it! Not only are your current employees already used to your internal systems, tech stack, learning platform, company values, and goals, but they already know how to do the core parts of their jobs. In theory, they can start applying their newly-acquired knowledge as soon as they finish their course and, if they have any questions along the way, they already have pre-established relationships to lean upon.\xa0 The more you explore upskilling and reskilling your learners and they become Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their own right, the more they will start to see things from a different perspective and come up with new and better ways of doing things. This new way of thinking stirs up your usual processes and increases efficiency, meaning that your teams can operate on full power throughout the year. The obvious result is improved individual and business performance, which acts as a catalyst to spur new innovations and works to set you apart from your competitors. As businesses start realizing the power of learning, they unlock their secret weapon that makes them stand out in their market.\xa0 While upskilling and reskilling seems like the cure-all remedy that we’re all searching for, it’s important to remember that this process needs to be a continuous cycle if you want to see real results. Before you even begin to think about working on a upskilling and reskilling strategy, sit down with your C-Suite or senior managers and align with them on where they want the business to go in the upcoming year. What are their revenue goals? What   will each team be given to help the business reach those goals? What are their concerns?\xa0Without this background, how can you possibly decide what areas to focus on and have tangible measures of success? Once your objectives and goals are aligned with that of the business, the next step is regular employee skills analysis so that you become familiar with everyone’s strengths and where their skills are lacking.\xa0This information will guide you in finding the best candidates for your upskilling and reskilling strategy, and ensures that you will match the right person with the right learning program.

", "With a thriving job market, employees have the luxury of being choosy.\xa0 Offering good compensation is no longer enough to attract the best employees or to retain them.\xa0People want to feel passionate about their work, have access to cutting-edge technology, gain access to learning and development opportunities, and pave their own career path.\xa0 The sum of all these parts and everything in between is what makes up the overall employee experience. A subpar employee experience can have a ripple effect across the organization, shaping everything from how engaged people are to their enthusiasm for the company’s mission.\xa0\xa0 According to  , only 32% of employees are actively engaged at work, meaning the vast majority of employees are not performing at their best because they are disengaged. Companies that seek employees\xa0who are already motivated and enthusiastic sometimes forget their end of the deal. To keep employees committed, you must invest in them. If you're looking to overhaul your employee experience and reignite the spirit within your company culture,\xa0read on to learn five ways to get started!\xa0\xa0 Digital adoption within a company is seen as a competitive advantage to many modern job seekers. No one wants to show up on the first day at their dream job just to find out they’re not the forward-thinking company they signed up for. Without the right resources, doing any job becomes a massive headache.  begins by giving your employees the right tools they need to do their job well. It’s a common misconception that incorporating more technology into your employee’s day will be a productivity vacuum. But in reality, investing in ways to alleviate the pain points of your employee’s workload communicates that they are a true priority. In the same vein, forcing technology and software\xa0on your employees won’t be your ticket to success either. A  surveyed 580 organizations across the globe and found a staggering correlation between allowing employees to choose what technology they use at work and their overall job satisfaction.\xa0 Sixty-eight percent of people stated they were more productive while 37% claimed to have improved creativity when given the choice to use their preferred device. Granting employees autonomy to pick which tools complement their working styles translates into more loyal, dedicated employees.\xa0 With changing work environments, employees want a stronger sense of control. In another   with over 12,000 participants, they found that 90% of leaders believe they are choosing tech options with their people in mind, but 53% of employees don’t see it that way. Employees feel that the technology and software being chosen for them isn’t done so knowledgeably. And we all know that when a person can’t do their job efficiently, the employee experience inevitably takes a nosedive.\xa0 Trust is a central part of all human relationships. Without\xa0it in the workplace, it can be difficult to build a strong connection with your employees.\xa0 To understand the principles of trust, Professor\xa0  gives an insightful TED Talk on what it is and how to build (or rebuild) it. Frei believes that when people learn to trust more, there will be unprecedented human progress because trust fuels productivity. Trust has three moving parts: authenticity, logic, and empathy. Each of these characteristics of trust must be intact in order for trust to be granted.\xa0 Imagine a work culture where the employees have little trust in their leaders. Do you think people are able to show up each day ready to work,\xa0passionate about their company? This trust is a vital aspect to the employee experience and can determine how productive your employees actually are.\xa0 It’s important to remember that trust is a two-way street. People expect managers to be honest in their feedback, strategic in their guidance, and true advocates for their employees. But while trust is often granted to higher-ups from the start, it’s sometimes unrequited to junior employees. By granting trust to your employees, you create space for growth and autonomy.\xa0 More companies are embracing trust as a gateway to autonomy. With this independence, employees grow more confident in their role, find fulfillment in that mastery, and eventually own projects that bring value to the company. In those organizations executives expect  , not just the top.\xa0 Workplace learning and development (L&D) looks vastly different than it did 30 years ago. Instead of sitting through lengthy mandatory lectures, employees are actively seeking learning opportunities that support their individual learning styles and goals.\xa0 Making personal and professional development a priority in your company can directly impact productivity and retention. In  , they found that 82% of executives are championing employee engagement through professional development. L&D professionals are now proactively seeking skill gaps in various ways, such as conducting internal assessments and making room in meetings with senior executives. As the progression of technology speeds up, new pathways for personal and professional development begin to take shape. Because of these opportunities, more\xa0money is allocated for\xa0online learning solutions. Nothing can fully replace the value of face-to-face learning, but no one can deny the benefits of online learning tools.\xa0 While it’s refreshing to know many employees are seeking ways to improve themselves, in an  , 84% of U.S. workers still believe there is a skills gap among employees in the workplace. So giving the opportunity to upskill is necessary for two reasons: your company simply won’t keep up with its competitors and\xa0employees are demanding it.\xa0 Upskilling isn’t just the act of completing a new certification, it’s promoting a growth-mindset and creating the right behaviors to match. Allowing employees to take charge of their own learning path can give a new sense of confidence and autonomy, but it’s important for managers to provide guidance so they know where to focus their development.\xa0 In your  , ask them specific questions regarding their interest in learning and development. Knowing what drives your employees can provide you with an opportunity to connect on a personal and professional level.\xa0 Career development has changed significantly over the years. There used to be a standard career path to follow: you put in the same amount of time and did the same type of work as those before you, climbing the proverbial career ladder. The modern employee no longer wants to wait years for a promotion, and they don’t have to. The idea of working at one company for a lifetime is now unthinkable, and as the stigma of job-hopping has lessened, employees feel more comfortable doing it. A   noted that 45% of college grads will stay at a job fewer than two years, and by age 35,\xa025% of workers will have held five jobs or more. Valued employees who are dissatisfied with their career development can easily leave a company and land in a new job with a better salary. So what can a company do to keep employees around? As people managers, you have to recognize that your employees are making career assessments all the time. It’s your job to provide guidance on the development process with information, feedback, and continued motivation. Career paths are no longer static, so instead of focusing employees on attaining a specific role, help them grow their skills by giving the right kind of feedback.\xa0 In a recent study by  , data\xa0shows that employees actually enjoy feedback. Unfortunately, 44% of managers\xa0don't give enough.\xa0Don’t be afraid to share your insights with your employees if you feel it could be useful to them as they plan out their career path. Managers can effectively drive employee engagement by helping to map out a personalized career plan. Planning short- and long-term growth plans shows your employees that the organization not only cares for them, but wants to see them excel.\xa0 Collaboration\xa0is mutually beneficial for every team member and has proven to be a huge catapult for success.\xa0 Before a company can focus on collaboration, it must\xa0look at how its employees communicate with one another. In a workplace, gossip and negative speech can disintegrate any trust or motivation that may have once existed. The only way to combat this type of work environment is to learn how to communicate honestly and with tactful feedback. Relationships can determine the quality of our day-to-day lives, and allowing for honest feedback and open communication will strengthen the quality of these connections. It’s through these relationships built on trust that the groundwork for collaboration can be set.\xa0 In a global survey conducted by  , they found that good collaboration is simply the ease of communication. Most companies struggle with unclear communication; making joint cooperation toward a common goal impossible. In a negative environment, it’s unlikely that this problem will be solved no matter how many seminars employees sit through.\xa0 Making the shift into a more enjoyable and productive workspace requires a collective effort from your team members and a sense of psychological safety. Psychological safety is the foundation of strong professional relationships and is the belief that your environment is safe for interpersonal risk taking. When teams feel comfortable enough to be vulnerable with their teammates and communicate openly, collaboration becomes organic. When it comes down to it, people have the desire to collaborate, but often times they either don’t know how or don’t feel truly empowered. Managers, finding the solution begins with you. Have regular check-ins with you employees and find out what their challenges are, and if you see that working in silos is becoming a habit, work with them to break the cycle.\xa0 Without talented and dedicated people, a company won’t achieve what they set out to, no matter how great the idea. Businesses recognize that to stay competitive, they must find ways to bring out their employees’ best performance and create a culture that brings a strong sense of belonging and purpose.\xa0 The modern worker does not separate their work and personal life into two separate categories, and why would they when work consumes such a large portion? Giving your employees an opportunity to become their best selves and gain skills they can use in and out of the workplace are how companies achieve extraordinary success.\xa0 Read about  and  , two factors that help with improving employee experience.

Just as when you first started your job, it can take a while to align with the business and start earning your keep. So how can you avoid this period of unproductivity? You guessed it! Not only are your current employees already used to your internal systems, tech stack, learning platform, company values, and goals, but they already know how to do the core parts of their jobs. In theory, they can start applying their newly-acquired knowledge as soon as they finish their course and, if they have any questions along the way, they already have pre-established relationships to lean upon.\xa0 The more you explore upskilling and reskilling your learners and they become Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their own right, the more they will start to see things from a different perspective and come up with new and better ways of doing things. This new way of thinking stirs up your usual processes and increases efficiency, meaning that your teams can operate on full power throughout the year. The obvious result is improved individual and business performance, which acts as a catalyst to spur new innovations and works to set you apart from your competitors. As businesses start realizing the power of learning, they unlock their secret weapon that makes them stand out in their market.\xa0 While upskilling and reskilling seems like the cure-all remedy that we’re all searching for, it’s important to remember that this process needs to be a continuous cycle if you want to see real results. Before you even begin to think about working on a upskilling and reskilling strategy, sit down with your C-Suite or senior managers and align with them on where they want the business to go in the upcoming year. What are their revenue goals? What   will each team be given to help the business reach those goals? What are their concerns?\xa0Without this background, how can you possibly decide what areas to focus on and have tangible measures of success? Once your objectives and goals are aligned with that of the business, the next step is regular employee skills analysis so that you become familiar with everyone’s strengths and where their skills are lacking.\xa0This information will guide you in finding the best candidates for your upskilling and reskilling strategy, and ensures that you will match the right person with the right learning program. The final hurdle is scaling your strategy, something that learning technologies have taken off your plate. With a   that can grow with your business, you can collect more data on your teams and provide targeted learning programs to your workforce.

To drive consistent sales growth, they follow a set, repeatable pattern in their sales work. It includes mapping the buyer journey, buyer personas, sales cycles, referral programs, and more. Generally, organizations that see long-term growth guide their sales reps through every step of their sales journey. A well-defined sales cycle helps you with the following advantages: When creating a sales cycle, you need to factor in:\xa0 Selling a B2B product requires relatively more decision-makers, high-value deals, and a longer   cycle. Whereas for consumer goods, the sales cycle tends to be shorter because of the (usually) lower deal value and the smaller number of decision-makers involved. In either case, while most sales cycles have a set of common logical steps, they need to be customized according to the product and the type of buyer. Now that you know what a sales cycle is and why it is necessary, let’s look at the different stages of a sales cycle. The first stage in a sales cycle is prospecting for customers, i.e., identifying potential customers. First, you need to define your ideal buyer persona by answering the following two questions:\xa0\xa0 As you continue to think and find answers to these questions, you get a clear idea of your product’s unique selling point and key  . Once you identify your USP and KVP, you can easily define your ideal customer profile or buyer persona. After creating your ideal buyer persona, generate a database of potential leads who match that profile. This can be done via lead databases such as Zoominfo, Crunchbase, or popular social media platforms like LinkedIn. For B2B, you also need to identify the individual prospects that you can contact – decision-makers or those who have the power to influence the purchasing decisions. In the second stage, prepare and research your prospects. If you’re a B2B vendor, you need to know a prospect’s company history, business type, top customers, key competitors, industry insights, recent achievements, and so on. You can get this information from their company website, press releases, social media handles, websites like G2, and many other similar platforms. If you sell directly to a customer, research their key demographics, needs, concerns, and limitations. Once you’re prepared, you also need to identify the best ways to contact your ideal buyer persona. It could be through emails, cold calls, social media, or a combination of different communication channels and methods. In the third stage, you contact the prospects for the first time. The first call is a do-or-die moment for most businesses. You get one shot at creating a great first impression. Use this call to understand your prospects and their needs.\xa0 Ask  . While setting any sales target for the current financial year, ask your prospects how they plan to achieve these targets; determine their approach. Asking open-ended questions allows customers to talk, helping you to build a good rapport at the same time.\xa0 Do not pitch your product just yet. First, provide an overview of your product and qualify the prospects to see if they’re fit to move forward in the sales funnel. You can use  , a popular framework, to qualify prospects.\xa0 The initial   aims not to sell but to know more about the prospects, their motivations, and key pain points. You should use the introductory pitch to make a positive impression and earn your prospect’s trust.\xa0 Presenting your product or service is the most important stage in a sales cycle. You have identified, contacted, and qualified the prospects. Now you pitch your product. Sales reps often only talk about a product’s features, which isn’t enough. To improve conversions, your pitch should include the following aspects. While qualifying the prospects, you also learn more about their needs. Therefore, explain the product features that are relevant to a prospect’s needs. If you’re selling a   to a sales manager, explain how it provides a 360-degree overview of all buyer interactions rather than how it’s used to automate marketing campaigns. Your pitch should address a prospect's immediate needs. What is the unique difference between your product and the others on the market? Is it cheaper, easier to use, or has additional features? Emphasize this in your pitch. Identifying and presenting your product’s USP will help your product stand out in a prospect’s mind. Specify the expected business outcomes of using your product. If you’re selling a  , clearly explain what marketing goals the prospect can achieve using your product ( improved email campaigns, enhanced social media marketing, etc.). Make sure your prospects know why they’re using your product and what results are expected. Quantify the outcome in monetary terms - improve revenue by 23%, save $500 per user, and so on. The prospect should see the monetary value of purchasing your product, which enables quick decision-making.\xa0 Your sales pitch should be less about what your product has and more about what it does. Sell the shade, not the branch. Once you make the sales pitch, prospects start voicing their concerns about your product. Although sales reps face sales objections all the time, many fear these objections and view them as potential obstacles, whereas a prospect raising objections is actually a positive indicator. It shows that they’re considering your product but have some issues that need to be ironed out.\xa0 So what can you do to handle objections? Use the right tools and techniques to address concerns and resolve them in time.\xa0 One of the most widely used and effective techniques to handle sales objections is  , which includes: Actively listen to the prospects. Make sure that you don’t interrupt them while they’re talking. Often, sales reps interrupt the prospects by assuming what the objection is (commonly known as  ) and providing ready-made answers. If you have a prepared response, it means that you weren’t listening. You should always listen to understand, which shows that you care about your prospects and are keen to answer their questions. Acknowledging the objection shows the prospect that you’re actively listening. A simple way to acknowledge is to   or repeat the last few words or critical words of the objection. Suppose a prospect says, “I am not too sure if we can get into a contract with you at the moment,” you can acknowledge with, “I understand you have issues getting into a contract with us in the current situation.” There are two potential objections here. Acknowledging them will help you identify which is more important for the prospect - getting into a contract with you or getting into a contract under the present circumstances. Before exploring suitable responses, verify. Prospects may use objections as a smokescreen for something deeper. Often price objections are raised because the prospects don’t see any value in the offering. That’s why you need to probe further to understand the real objections and explore suitable responses. Once you have a clear understanding of the prospect’s objection, provide a suitable response. Be sure to address every objection. Unaddressed objections can be major deal-killers. You also need to be prepared and understand the top concerns of your prospects. Typically, sales objections are of the following types: The key to handling objections is preparation. Make a list of all the objections that you’re likely to encounter with the appropriate responses. Constantly update and share it with the rest of your team. At this stage of a sales cycle, prospects become paying customers. It is therefore important to close your sale using the right  . Some of these closing techniques are: Also, ensure that there’s minimum documentation and a simple billing process to create a smooth buying experience for the prospects. It’s not the sole responsibility of the customer success or support team to retain the customer. The sales teams also play a major role in this.\xa0 You were their first  ; they purchased the product from you because they trusted you. It’s now up to you to maintain a good working relationship with the customers - follow them up, check for any issues, and ask for feedback. If you have any customer marketing initiatives, invite your customers and share relevant materials. Keep them informed of product and feature updates. This will help your customers get the maximum benefit from your product while getting you repeat business and referrals. Remember, it’s easier and cheaper to retain an existing customer than gain a new one. Effective sales cycles should factor in the buyer's journey as well. This includes having a thorough understanding of your buyer persona, their requirements, preferred communication channels, and other relevant details.  is complete before the first contact with a sales rep. So, for your sales cycle to be effective, sales and marketing should be appropriately aligned to ensure that only suitable prospects are targeted.\xa0 The sales cycle is the bedrock of successful sales strategies. A good sales cycle shouldn’t be a stagnant, one-time affair but constantly evolve with the circumstances. Sales teams need to be fully familiar with the sales cycle to navigate the sales storm successfully. Step up your sales team's progress by visualizing complex information and data using a  . ", 'You have leads in your CRM. Now how do you nurture and keep them interested in your product if they are not ready to buy yet?  nurturing is crucial to your business because only a small percentage of leads that come in are ready to purchase your product or services. Surprisingly, only   in their marketing efforts. For the companies not using nurturing, their leads are sitting in their CRM with no activity. Chances are, following up with old leads who have had no activity for a few months have already moved on to a competitor. Lead nurturing is the process of developing relationships with prospects throughout their buying\xa0cycle. Lead nurturing takes place at every stage of the sales funnel, from the moment that you first collect a prospect’s information, until the time that they buy your product. Even then, the process of relationship building doesn’t stop once they become a customer.  strategies focus on learning more about and educating your prospects. You learn\xa0more about them through the information that they share. You learn more about them through the engagement data that you collect. Then, you use that data to deliver targeted messaging that educates, builds a relationship, and (over time) begins to subtly push prospects toward making a purchase. Lead nurturing isn’t a strategy you hope to install – it’s a necessity. Most companies that are generating revenue are lead nurturing in some form (even if by hand) to secure those sales and ensure that your prospects develop trust with their company over time. With sales cycles lasting between 3-12 months for most B2B businesses, creating opportunities for constant interaction is required. But designing a lead nurturing program can be difficult. You know you should be  , content assets, and   ads for prospects at specific points in your sales funnel. But how do you do that? What kind of content do you create? What kind of goals will each nurturing sequence have? Once you have a foundation in place, you can start getting creative and designing nurturing sequences for specific customer segments. But until you have those foundational nurtures in place, you should place your focus on designing and testing those. Foundational nurtures are designed to speak to prospects at specific points in the buying cycle. They can include email sequences that are delivered to cold leads with no prior interactions, educational materials to those in the middle of the funnel, sales materials to those reaching their buying decision, and more.\xa0 The cold prospecting nurture is the “prospecting” nurture. Typically, prospecting nurtures are sent to targeted lists of prospects. These lists may be built in-house, comprised of internal prospect data, or through purchased lists from third-party data vendors. Increasing lead generation is the most common goal for companies using marketing automation. Using your lists, prospecting nurtures allow you to deliver carefully crafted messages to prospects that narrowly fall within your core personas parameters. But — slow down. It’s important to understand that prospecting nurtures aren’t SPAM. They aren’t messages thrown out blindly, en masse, to attract customers. The goal of a prospecting nurture is not to convince your prospect to buy right now, but rather to make them aware of your company and show them the value that you offer. Then, if they so choose, they can explore your offering further on their own.\xa0  nurtures can take a wide range of shapes and sizes. Above, we recommend sending between six and ten emails over the course of four to eight weeks. The truth is that there is no right or wrong answer here as the appropriate length and time frame depends on your industry and offer. More expensive or more complicated products may require more education and trust-building from your prospects. In the middle of the funnel, your focus shifts away from building awareness toward engaging prospects and collecting more information from them. The more you know, the more your sales teams can use to close deals at a later date. Additionally, your marketing teams will have more data to work with to personalize the communications that you send. Each email is a middle-of-funnel nurturing sequence that should be delivered with a different goal in mind. Those goals might be to continue to build awareness of your product, educate them on vital features, or educate them on the value that your product could potentially provide to their organization. Depending on the goal of each individual email in a sequence, there is a wealth of different educational materials that you can deliver to prospects at this point in the process. Providing a wealth of educational content in the middle of the funnel can help you improve your company’s standing in the eyes of the prospect and further their understanding of the value that your product provides. In these nurtures, you should be less focused on making the sale and more focused on ensuring that you are doing everything that you can to educate your prospects and further their understanding of your offering.\xa0 Once a prospect has received enough educational material about your product to understand it in full, it’s time to move them down the funnel and again shift the type of communications that you deliver. Often, nurturing sequences will shift toward the bottom of the funnel/sales content based on trigger actions that the customer takes. These might be clicking on your product pages, asking a question, engaging with a sales rep, or simply asking for sales-specific information. Bottom of the funnel (aka BOFU) nurturing sequences are generally shorter. We recommend delivering 3-5 emails over the course of 2-4 weeks. Remember, you’re making “the ask” on the sale here and providing some last-minute need-to-know information to influence their final buying decision. We don’t want to draw things out too much. They have the information that they need to make a\xa0decision. Our goal is to nudge them toward making that decision. End-of-funnel content can come in many different forms. You might offer your prospects a free assessment of your product. You might send them a link to a landing page that asks them to buy your product. You might gift them with a free trial of your product. There is an unending number of ways to facilitate the sale, but ultimately the way that you make your final pitch will depend on your offer and the educational materials that you have delivered throughout the nurturing process. Use what you have taught them to position your product as the perfect solution to their problems Once a prospect has gone through your full nurture program and declines to make a purchase, that doesn’t mean that your nurturing is done. Different customers reach their buying decisions at different speeds. Sometimes a prospect is receiving your closing nurture when in reality, they need months of more relationship building before they are ready to be. Or perhaps they have an interest in your product but just aren’t in a position to buy currently.\xa0Your long-term drip nurture sequence should go out less-often than earlier sequences. They’ve\xa0already received a bulk of the information at this point. Now, you want to make sure that you are sending them high-quality content that will further the understanding that they already have. The content delivered during a long-term drip should, in many ways, look similar to that of a middle of funnel nurture sequence. A heavier focus on product updates can also be helpful, and in some cases may be the final nudge that a prospect needs to decide to buy.\xa0 The nurturing process doesn’t end when the prospect makes a sale. The focus just shifts. You might have upsells, cross-sells, or other products that you may want to draw their attention toward. Those would require nurtures that are a bit more “salesy” in nature and focus on slowly\xa0working your way toward conversion. Additionally, you could use a post-sale nurture sequence for more general relationship building or reducing churn. These nurtures would use more educational, middle-of-funnel-type content. Lead nurturing is a vital component of any . Knowing how to structure different nurturing sequences around specific stages of the funnel can help you to walk customers through the buying process while building awareness, educating them about your product, and ultimately making them a loyal brand advocate.\xa0 ', "Having trouble converting prospects to leads? You might be targeting the wrong people. It seems no matter what industry you're in, the question on everyone's mind seems to be the same: how do I convert high-value leads into deals closed?

It seems like a simple enough solution, after-all, this is something you learn in business school. But if you're having trouble sourcing and closing leads, maybe it's time for a little refresh.\xa0 Take a moment to think back on your experience as a consumer.

When you create a customer profile, you're creating the playbook for how to then convert that high-profile lead into a sale.\xa0 Without the right communication strategy, sales talking points, or understanding of what motivates the buyer, you might as well forget lead qualifying all together. It's not enough to know someone might purchase from you. You have to know what tactics will make them sign on the dotted line. Customer profiling helps you achieve that. Once you understand the customer motivation, fears, and desires, you can create the playbook for your sales team that will lead them to an easy close.\xa0 Becoming familiar with your brand and its customers takes a lot of time. Oftentimes, new employees can take months to familiarize themselves with the brand and its products. A robust customer profile can help these employees skip the learning curve and get more familiar with your company and its offerings faster and more efficiently. This means less time in training and more time chasing down those high-profile deals you're looking to close.\xa0 Whether you work in sales, product, or marketing, chances are you've worked with an   before. Maybe your team rolled out a new feature and everyone needs to know how to talk about it.\xa0 Customer profiles serve the same purpose when speaking with potential leads. It allows everyone to be on the same page and strategize about how certain customers like being  communicated with, what motivates them, and what turns them off.\xa0 If you ever played Sims growing up – does that age me? – then think of customer profiles like that. You’re building an avatar of sorts, a persona that describes a wide swath of your customers. Of course, each customer is a unique snowflake, but for the sake of marketing, it’s easiest to group customers together based on their similarities. Let's dive into the step-by-step process of creating a customer profile. Identifying your ideal customer is worthless if that customer doesn't help you reach your annual goals. What is the biggest focus your company has this year? Is it XXXX number of sales of a certain product? More sign-ups on your website? Increased social media followers? A customer profile can help you achieve all of those.\xa0 Once you've identified your goals, then you can focus on how the customer works into that. A hundred new purchases of ABC product won't matter if your goal was to sell XYZ product. Your goals and your target customers should align perfectly.\xa0 The hard truth is that your business isn't the only one targeting your ideal customer. That's why focusing on what makes your brand or product unique is crucial. Think about the last product you bought. It was probably because it stood out in a unique way and caught your attention. Pinpointing these differences is the first step in convincing a potential customer that you can solve their problem better than a competitor.\xa0 One thing we see here at G2 a lot is brands using their  to highlight customer satisfaction to potential leads. These verified user-reviews are coming from current customers and help companies highlight what real users love about their products. Once you've pinpointed your long-term goals and what makes your product unique, it's time to put that into perspective with your ideal customer. Your buyer persona should outline a few high-level things about a potential customer, those in turn will help you build your customer profile. These are two separate things that work together to create the perfect strategy for attracting new customers. Here are a few of the things you should keep in mind about a potential customer.\xa0 These are the basic facts about your customers. You can probably glean this information simply by observing them. Important demographic information includes: age, city, gender, race, ethnicity, and more. For example, if you're looking to sell a CRM software, your ideal customer probably works in the marketing department. You would likely want to target the CMO because they understand why your product is important to them and they are a decision-maker.\xa0 Socioeconomic considerations could be household income, education, neighborhood, occupation, and household composition. This can also translate into what type of business your ideal customer works for. If you know your product is pricey, it might be best to target enterprise companies rather than small businesses in order to maximize your chances of success.\xa0 This includes interests, hobbies, favorite TV shows (and music, websites, media, etc.), spending habits, anxieties, and political views, to name a few. If you know your ideal customer reads a certain industry blog or website, it could be to your benefit to write a  on that website to get your product or business in front of that customer. You could also regularly interact with certain social media accounts you know your ideal customer follows.\xa0 Why do customers use your brand? What do they get out of it? How often do they use the product or receive the service? Knowing how loyal your customers are is important, as there is spending power behind customer loyalty. A reported   of U.S. consumers stated they were likely to spend more on brands they were loyal to compared to other brands. Evaluate whether your ideal customer is already loyal to another brand. How can you flip them to becoming a loyal customer of yours? Is it worth trying? What makes them like another brand and does your brand do it better? These are all things to consider.\xa0 One more thing you should consider is what makes a great customer. It might be tempting to go after the biggest companies with the most high-profile leaders – but that doesn't always make someone a good customer. These are just a few things to get you started.\xa0Your brand is unique, which means your customer profile will be unique as well. Don't be afraid to branch out from these suggestions. Once you've got all that information, you can put it together and create your customer persona.\xa0 After you aggregated this data about your customers, group them into buckets based on similarities. Most likely, you will have more than one customer profile. For your own sanity, I’d try to create no more than five profiles. Plus, if you have more than five, perhaps your product or service is too broad and thus not strongly appealing to specific people. Once created, customer profiles can help you decide which   to embark on. These can help your overall brand awareness and bring new customers into the sales pipeline that you might have otherwise missed.\xa0 Customer profiles can also guide your . Now you know which medium will be most effective for reaching your different customers: TV ads, Facebook, in-store promotions, Pinterest, newspaper, direct mail, Twitter, radio, etc. You’ll know which promotions your customers are most interested in. This could be events, giveaways, new products, demos or discounts.  you’ll know what images, fonts, colors, jokes, and references will catch their attention. Customer profiles will also reveal what you can do to convince customers that what you offer is the   offering around. You can alleviate any anxiety by touting warranties, exceptional customer service, guarantees, etc. This exercise shows what will   work, which is equally as important as knowing what will. For example, if your   is in high school, don’t reference  Or if your customers tend to be above 55-years-old, don’t use tiny, hard-to-read fonts. On the sales side of things, you can use   to help you sort all the information you just gathered and strategize appropriately. The software can help you pair up customer profiles with individual leads and prospects, so you can use similar sales pitches to the marketing messaging you used for those customers. If your marketing or sales efforts aren’t quite striking gold, take a time-out and evaluate your customers. Think about what it is you need to know so you can satisfy their needs. Decide what research method to conduct in order to gather this data: email surveys, focus groups, face-to-face feedback, etc. This exercise may take some time, but it’s worth it. Remember, if you don’t know   you’re selling to, you can’t know  to sell. \xa0 "], 28: ['If you’re currently in school or you’ve been working for a while, chances are you’ve used Skype at some point.

Inability to keep up with demand, lack of product innovation, insufficient resources - all of these factors come down to one core financial issue.\xa0 Alright, here’s the answer: 43% of   their biggest financial challenge is  .\xa0 And this is a major problem for businesses eager to scale and grow. Covering operating expenses is the baseline of a healthy business and is the only way to keep yourself afloat while you expand offerings, grow operations, and avoid closing your doors.\xa0\xa0 In  , we showed you how to get your business off the ground using a customer-led growth strategy. Now it’s time to take it a step further and see how you can efficiently scale your business without doing too much, too quickly.\xa0 Are you ready to tackle your business growth challenges? This playbook shows you how to do it by investing in the right tools that support your growth, finding and maintaining strategic partnerships to fill the right gaps in your functionality, and tapping into your customers’ needs for long-lasting business success.\xa0 New business owners who see fast success often find themselves in a never-ending cycle behind the growth ball. They’re selling products, revenue is coming in, and demand is increasing, but they aren’t sure how to keep up.\xa0 Once you’re up and running, the next step is figuring out how to grow your revenue, while scaling the operations of your company in a reasonable and sustainable way. You don’t want to scale too much, too quickly or you’ll find yourself perpetually behind the ball. Best case, this will lead to burnout and worst case, solvency.\xa0 To put this into perspective,   shows that business owners with no employees spent $18,000 in their first year while businesses with one to four employees spent $60,000 in their first year. Trying to scale from a handful of employees to a robust team overnight is costly and may take away from other unexpected costs.\xa0 Before attempting to scale up operations, make sure your business is fully equipped with S.M.A.R.T. goals, the right technology, resources, and enough funding to execute on these goals and support operational investments. Figure out your endgame. In a perfect world, what does success look like as it relates to your venture? Be specific when pinpointing your goal, think long-term, and don’t compromise on your vision. Once you’ve clearly articulated your ideal outcome, simply reverse engineer it. You know where you want to be, so what do you need to get there?\xa0 The most important element to focus on is making sure your ideal customer profile (ICP) is in line with your vision of expansion and growth.\xa0 Krish Subramanian describes how   managed to scale by reverse-engineering their desired outcome, starting with their ideal customer profile: “One thing that has helped us scale is investing more time [in the] best customers for whom [Chargebee is] a good fit.” Subramanian explains, “In B2B, there are lots of customers [and you won’t] be able to satisfy every single need they have. It’s harder to stretch and make them happy if you want to win all of them.” “Grinding it out” is fun - until it’s not. The late hours and manual work required when getting a business off the ground are hallmarks of a great story. However, these hallmarks are usually what lead to the demise of a company altogether.\xa0 Grit, late hours, and manual work won’t scale effectively as your business grows. Therefore, the technology you invest in to mitigate these things are critical to achieving lasting, cost-effective growth.\xa0 But is there an ROI to investing in more technology? Yes, actually -   experience  compared to those that don’t. And despite that incredible growth data,   still do not take full advantage of available technology. Certain processes, such as sales outreach, marketing communications, and customer account management, can be easily automated with technology. Putting systems in place to handle these evergreen needs will help mitigate risks young businesses can’t afford to take, like excessive manual data entry, potential inaccuracies, and wasted time. These systems can then easily support you at whatever rate of growth your business takes. Always keep an eye on your competitors and find out what they’ve done to grow in your industry. While you never want to copy another brand’s strategy, you can always learn from their tactics and apply them to your business.\xa0 If you’re looking for a more personal learning channel, reach out directly to other entrepreneurs and experts in your space for advice. If there’s one thing you can count on, it’s knowing that every entrepreneur was at some point in your shoes with the same questions, harboring the same concerns. And there’s no one better person to talk through those issues with than someone who’s already navigated them.\xa0 Although your strategy and operations are likely to change as you scale, it’s important to protect your business’s core values. Don’t lose sight of your end goal, and make sure your team feels confident in the growth roadmap. Use your internal data to help you predict what your customers want and how they will adapt to your scaling business.\xa0 Picture this: you get your business off the ground, your proof of concept is widely adopted, and demand for your product is through the roof. What could go wrong? If you’re not careful, everything. Your current funding model may support   operations, but you now have to scale up your staff, resources, technology, and support to take on the additional demand staring you down the barrel.\xa0 While you can revisit ideas like crowdfunding or additional bank loans, there are other ways to receive financing to scale your business.\xa0 Speaking of partnering, finding a business to partner with is an incredibly effective way for you to scale and grow long-term. However, not all partners are created equal.\xa0 Your partners must be aligned with your business’ product and values. At the most basic level, a good partnership should include similar customer profiles and products that complement each other — or ideally, integrate. A partnership should benefit you from a business owner’s perspective while also actively adding value for your customer.\xa0 In other words, think of the good old “1+1 = 3” formula: my product, plus their product, equals a whole greater than the sum of its parts. You want to look at your product and say “no other company can deliver solutions as good as ours through this partnership.” It’s important to note that while you want to partner with brands that align with yours, you don’t want to work with companies that could potentially take away business. Your products should complement each other. If your partner offers the same or similar solutions, you don’t want your customers to simply choose their product over yours.\xa0 When looking for the right partner, ask yourself:\xa0 Identifying a strategic partner is just the beginning. Once you find the right fit, you need to ensure both parties follow through with and sustain the partnership for the long run. You must lay the groundwork for your partnership and dedicate effort to getting both teams aligned on a joint strategy, goals, and outcomes.\xa0 Godard Abel describes how business owners can leverage their strategic partnerships to scale their company to the next growth level: “Once you have a partnership going, especially with a big partner, [you can] have them invest. I’ve found that [when] bigger platform partners invest, it’s helpful because now both parties have a mutually vested interest in your company making money.”\xa0 “When building my last company, [we were] very much focused on [our partnership with] Salesforce and that ecosystem,” Abel reflects. “And we leveraged their massive distribution and customer base to get our product in front of buyers we otherwise may not have been able to reach.” Each partnership is unique; however, all partnerships require trust beyond leaders. Once you’ve established a partnership between you and your counterpoint, you should heavily focus on departmental alignment. Make sure your product teams are constantly communicating and working together on the functionality. Connect your sales and marketing teams with their counterparts to discuss messaging, promotion, campaign strategies, and co-selling opportunities. The three phases of a strong and successful partnership are: The Chargebee and   integration is a perfect example of a successful partnership. Chargebee’s product provides a robust billing system for businesses. It helps sales and marketing teams run special promotions and gives support teams the right tools to bill accurately and respond quickly to billing queries.\xa0 Chargebee’s product also provides recurring payment and subscription management. Therefore, the company offers integration with GoCardless, a leader in account-to-account payments. By utilizing this partnership, users are able to efficiently manage subscribers and scale their subscription business.\xa0 “Chargebee has fantastic partnerships,” Takeuchi explains. “A good lever to market is to work through partners, empower them, and enable them to help their customers to get paid, but embedding that really deeply into the workflows of that specific use case and that customer.” Don’t lose sight of how you got this thing off the ground in the first place. Your growth is customer-led from insights and by building trust with the market through reviews and testimonials. Now you need to leverage that power to sustain success and continue to grow your business. While investing in technology and partnerships are crucial for growth, tapping into your customer sentiment is the true key to lasting, long-term success.\xa0 The benefits of your customers’ voice are tremendous. You can leverage your customers’ voice to spread brand awareness, help users make confident purchase decisions, and drive product strategy and innovation internally.\xa0 When’s the last time you made a major purchase without reading the reviews first?   more than any other factor, and as businesses continue to fight through this crisis of trust, the sentiment of other users is more important than ever.\xa0 Social proof instills confidence in buyers who are exploring different products or solutions. This means that buyers will lean on platforms like blogs, forums, and review sites to research and shortlist providers.\xa0 And reviews don’t just benefit potential customers. On third-party review sites like G2, consistently soliciting user reviews can provide you with an arsenal of highly valuable  . When your customers leave reviews, those reviews affect how you rank on results pages and reports. The more visitors you get to your profile, the more data you have on your audience.\xa0 In essence,   will help you spread brand awareness and gather applicable buyer intent data.\xa0 The future of business success depends on customer-led growth strategies. Shifting your focus on customer needs and values will help drive product strategy and innovation within your company. Find out where customers see gaps in your product and work to make those changes.\xa0 Let’s say your reviews uncover a common paint point: customer success users consistently express the need to filter and group account profiles by location in your CRM software. After conducting some research, you find that customer success individuals need this functionality to plan calls and email cadences based on time zones. You would then present this information to your product team so they can work on creating this feature.\xa0 On the other hand, you can use this feedback to research potential partners. Instead of investing time and money into developing the feature, for instance, you could instead partner with a product that automatically schedules meetings and emails based on the location of individual accounts.\xa0 In short, you should always be collecting, analyzing, and implementing your customer feedback. The best way to earn trust and build long-lasting relationships is by interacting with and listening to your customers.\xa0 Godard Abel built G2 on these PEAK values:  erformance,  ntrepreneurial Spirit,  uthenticity, and  indness. These values continue to drive G2 throughout all stages of development as we continue to scale business, find valuable partnerships, and sustain long-term success.\xa0 Whether you’re launching a new business or expanding on existing product offerings, it’s important to put the needs and values of your customers first. Leading with a customer-first mindset will help you tackle challenges and reach your next PEAK.\xa0 ', 'Imagine you are an amateur basketball player, and to be considered successful, you need to beat LeBron James one on one. Not a fair fight, is it? Now imagine how a small, family-owned convenience store feels going up against large enterprises like Walmart. Also, not a fair fight. Business size matters. And while there are benefits to being a small business, having the upper hand in America’s competitive economy is not one of them. That’s where the Small Business Administration comes in. Everybody could use a little back up every once in a while. When we feel supported, not only do we receive the help we need to succeed, but we also begin to feel more confident in our current venture. Just like our coworkers help us reach our professional goals, the SBA does the same for small businesses. The purpose of the Small Business Administration is to improve the economy by ensuring small businesses are included. There are certain itches that large enterprises just can’t scratch, which calls for the need of strong small businesses. In the current economy, small businesses provide some special benefits: The Small Business Administration was founded in 1953 by President Eisenhower after the Small Business Act was signed, which had the purpose of providing assistance and aiding in small business concerns. Throughout the years, the SBA has survived many threats of disbandment. Plans of elimination, budget cuts, and frozen expenses have come up over time, but the SBA has persisted in providing aid to America’s small businesses. The SBA can’t simply offer moral support to small businesses to work towards their mission. A pat on the back and a thumbs up for good luck won’t cut it when facing large enterprises. Through banks, credit unions, and other lenders, the Small Business Administration provides loans, disaster loans, and microloans to those that need them the most. Even some of the   have started with a loan from the SBA. The Loan Guarantee Program is in place to help small business owners and entrepreneurs get the loans they need to either start or expand their business. These loans range from $2-$5 million. The U.S. Department of the Treasury lays out an   of the Loan Guarantee Program with details on things like who has access to these loans, how much they can receive, and how they should be used. Interestingly enough, disaster loans can be given to not only small business owners and non-profit organizations, but also homeowners and renters. These loans provide those groups with the money they need to restore their home or business to the condition it was in before the disaster hit. They are typically distributed within 21 days, but if there is a situation where a lot of people are affected at once, like during a natural disaster, the volume of requests can result in delays. The Small Business Administration also distributes microloans to small businesses and non-profit organizations that act as child care centers. Microloans do not exceed $50,000 and can be used for either concrete goods or something abstract like management. The 8 (a) Business Development Program provides assistance to socially and economically disabled people in their aspirations to start their own small business. The beneficiaries of this program must prove they are economically and socially disadvantaged. People typically do this by showing their low net worth and creating a personal statement that shows examples of social distress. You can give an aspiring small business owner all the money you want, but for them to be successful, they need the know-how. The SBA includes entrepreneurial development programs that educate small business owners on everything from product development, to marketing. With some funding from the state, the SBA funds about 900 Small Business Development Centers. What is a small business development center? They are typically located within community colleges, state and university schools, and other places where people could potentially be interested in owning a small business. Women’s Business Centers (WBCs) are established with the hopes of helping women start, build, and grow their own small businesses. The women who take advantage of the resources are mentored and given training on business development and finance. WBCs create opportunities for women to become a part of the small business world, just like the SBA helps small businesses establish themselves in the overall economy. Thanks to the SBA, women have more opportunities to be a successful small business owner. Do you know a woman who has exceeded expectations in the small business world? Include her in G2’s   database so she can pass along her experience to aspiring female professionals. SCORE, the nation’s largest network of volunteers, works with the Small Business Administration to provide free or low-cost mentoring to aspiring small business owners. There are currently 300 SCORE chapters nationwide, and mentees can access their mentors in person, through email, or with video chats. SCORE mentors cover everything from drawing up a business plan to designing a product to hiring staff. Anything that deals with starting and growing a business, SCORE mentors will help small businesses get where they want to be. Veteran Business Outreach Centers (VBOC), run by the SBA, provide veterans with special grants and loans they need to build their small businesses. They even provide assistance to family members of veterans who are starting a small business. VBOCs also offer a service called Boots to Business, which is a business and entrepreneurial training program where active duty service members, veterans, and their spouses can receive education on the fundamentals of owning a business. In this economy, it is almost impossible for small businesses to compete with large enterprises. The Small Business Administration provides aspiring small business owners with the skills and resources they need to start and build their own business. And while I will never beat LeBron James in basketball, and a small business will never beat Walmart in terms of revenue, it’s a much fairer fight. ', 'If there is one thing that we all strive for, it’s balance. Balancing our careers with our personal lives,  , and munching on a carrot for every cookie we eat. All in all, we use these balancing strategies to learn, grow, and improve. Businesses shoot for the exact same thing. However, instead of work-life balance,  , or a diet plan, they like to call it economies of scale. Economies of scale are the cost benefits gained by companies when production becomes more efficient. A business achieves economies of scale when they boost production while also lowering costs. Essentially, economies of scale is a fancy phrase meaning that a business sees some positive changes when their production becomes more economical. Reaching the perfect balance between production and cost brings about certain benefits. As a company grows and produces more, they have a better chance of reducing costs. When the economy of scale is realized by a particular business, they start to reap certain benefits. Sounds pretty simple, right? Increase production and lower costs. Like a lot of business goals, it is easier said than done. Hitting that sweet spot takes time and effort, and a lot of  factors play into it. Economies of scale most directly affect production costs. When economies of scale occurs, businesses can experience two positive outcomes: So, let’s say a business has successfully increased output. That’s great, right?! Well, not all of the time, unfortunately. Sometimes, when a business expands outputs, it can come with increased costs, as opposed to its hoped-for opposite. This is called diseconomies of scale. They can occur as a result of both internal and external factors, and there are three main types. include physical limits to production. The biggest contributor to this is overcrowding. When a company grows too quickly, and they think they can achieve economies of scale simply by growing, the opposite can actually happen. is directly related to managing a large workforce. As a business grows, certain necessary functions can struggle and come across as unfocused. are out of control of the organization and include situations where the economy or industry within which a business works is not working in its favor. Some common external economies of scale includes lack of demanded  resources, constraints imposed on a business, or a change in the price of inputs. There are two different types of economies of scale that affect a business: internal and external. Internal economies of scale are controllable by management because they are happening within the organization. A business achieves internal economies of scale when they have simultaneously increased production and lowered costs.\xa0 Typically, internal economies of scale are achieved by larger organizations. They have more experience and knowledge of efficient production practices, the ability to buy in bulk, cheaper access to capital, and highly connected  . All of those factors contribute to achieving internal economies of scale. Below is a graphical representation of internal economies of scale. With internal economies of scale, a business can fall anywhere on the long run average cost (LAC) curve, which is a representation of the concept of savings made by increasing output. However, if the average cost starts to rise, they fall into diseconomies territory. External economies of scale occur outside of a business but within the industry it works within. They are achieved when some external factor positively affects an organizations  . When external economies of scale occurs, every business within the industry benefits. The representation of external economies of scale is a bit different. Take a look at it below. As opposed to a business falling somewhere on the LAC curve with internal economies of scale, external economies of scale shift the curve completely. When the industry or economy shifts, so does the curve. Businesses are forced to keep up if they want to  achieve external economies of scale. A business can’t achieve economies of scale overnight. There are multiple factors that go into efficiently producing goods and services. Let’s take a look at each one. This one seems pretty obvious, but when a business has lower input costs, economies of scale can occur. This is usually done by taking advantage of volume discounts by buying products in bulk. This doesn’t mean that businesses want to pay more for inputs - it means they want to get their money’s worth. Some inputs are going to cost more than others. Research,  , and hiring experienced professionals is expensive. However, if the efficiency of these inputs is increased, that can result in lowering the average cost of the product. When a business starts to produce more, they can start to use specialized machinery and labor practices. An example of this would be moving someone from a labor position into something more specialized and replacing them with a piece of equipment that specifically performs the task that a human once did. A business can also better organize its resources to achieve economies of scale. This includes establishing a chain of command and improving production and distribution techniques. Overall, practice makes perfect. The more a business learns about what works best for them, takes advantage of available resources, and adjusts processes when necessary, the more efficient they will be. This includes applying knowledge, adapting, and changing. Economies of scale is essentially growing and becoming more efficient at the same time. Expansion is usually seen as a good thing, but if one aspect of a business can’t keep up, everything else falls apart with it. Before expanding, businesses must first understand what factors will affect them the most throughout the process. '], 20: ["Cloud computing has become a fundamental requirement for most organizations. With this in mind,   is massively on the rise in the current day and age. In fact,   with 1,000 employees or more have a multi-platform strategy. The number is to rise to more than 90 percent by 2024. Between 2018 and 2021, worldwide spending on public cloud services is to grow to 73 percent, from $160B to $277B. Cloud computing has been around for so many years, and this sudden growth might surprise a lot of the industry players. Cloud computing became a phenomenon in the early 2000s. However, due to the lack of awareness about the potential of technology, many brands hesitated to adopt it for their products and processes. Bart McDonough, CEO of Agio, believes the recent rapid adoption of cloud is mainly due to the understanding of “ ” of the technology. As organizations expand their understanding of the enormous benefits of cloud computing, they are now more willing to conduct workload tests on cloud and even migrate entire applications to the cloud. Let's take a look at some major moments in cloud computing's recent history.\xa0 Since cloud computing simplifies the process of monitoring resource consumption, the brands were able to use it for development and services delivery with a much higher level of confidence. Gradually, real-time streaming services started processing data over the cloud. Capitalizing on the opportunity, Microsoft launched Power BI, a business analytics and intelligence tool with comprehensive interactive visualization. Tech giants are always eager to unleash breakthroughs to dominate the industry. In October 2019, Google announced a   that could revolutionize cloud computing. Google claims to achieve results that well beyond the limitations of conventional technology. A quantum machine has significant implications in areas like  . It actually makes today’s most powerful supercomputers look like toys. The Google device performs a mathematical calculation in fewer than  . In comparison, a modern supercomputer would require more than 10,000 years to complete the calculation. That’s not all. Google launched Stadia, a cloud gaming service where users can stream and can play AAA games on the go. All processing is done on the cloud, and users can play the games without requiring specialized gaming hardware. This is a massive breakthrough for gamers who now do not have to invest in expensive hardware. Kris is the CSO and Co-Founder of  . He is responsible for creating and implementing Egnyte's global information security and compliance management strategies, policies, and controls that protect all customers’ content and users. He notes that the future of cloud computing is on its own very robust track that impacts everyone. The latest news about quantum computing indicates very early theoretical advances that will take many years before it is going to be available to the public. Eventually, the same advances in quantum computing may expand the scope of what is available via cloud computing in general. The growth of cloud computing will only underscore the importance of getting people to focus on business value and customer acquisition first. The time and energy spent on foundational infrastructure requirements will be significantly offset by the core capabilities available immediately via cloud computing resources. As a result, key metrics like time to value will only become accelerated. As cloud computing becomes mainstream, organizations are now moving toward adopting it into the in-house processes. As such, almost all industries are witnessing an increase in the use of cloud-based platforms and services. Traditionally, all the marketing data/metrics (including campaign stats, strategy plan, number of engagement, etc.) were collected and reported separately. A marketer had to sit down with an analyst to connect all the dots to come up with a detailed picture that could then be used for setting up a future course of action. A cloud-based marketing platform is an end-to-end digital marketing platform that integrates with marketing tools such as emails, analytics tools, and social management measurement tools. All integrated data helps marketers build and optimize marketing strategies. The cloud-based marketing solution also allows simplifies the execution and management of multi-channel campaigns (social media, mobile, email, and web). The purpose of the marketing cloud platform is to help develop a great marketing strategy, improve customer engagement, and increase return on investment.\xa0 Gone are the days when the search for information required a library. These days, digitally-enabled classrooms to allow students to create and submit presentations online; attend classes remotely through web conferencing; and collaborate and participate in globally distributed projects. Hospital records before the era of cloud-based health management systems were notorious for their bulk. To figure out a course of treatment, hospital staff has to wade through a mountain of forms and files to discover patient history from paper files. Fast forward to today, all data is on secure cloud solutions. Information sharing and access among all relevant stakeholders (medical professionals and insurance) is a breeze. Cloud-based solutions ensure excellent and timely treatment without unnecessary delays. Recently a   from thousand of miles away. Such innovation could revolutionize the healthcare industry.\xa0 The future is bright for cloud computing. Analysts at IDC estimate that the field will evolve rapidly in the coming years, with almost   outside the normal data center. Moreover, 40% of organizations will deploy cloud technology, with edge computing becoming an integral part of the technological setup. Also, a quarter of end-point devices will be ready to execute AI algorithms by the year 2022. Cloud computing facilitates businesses to focus on achieving their goals, with performance at the core, without any fuss. When a five-pronged cloud computing phenomenon that leverages flexibility, agility, security, mobility, and scalability combines with existing processes, the level of business’ performance rises to a new level. The idea is to help businesses get computational power they need, and how they want it to work for them, and move on. Software development agencies tend to follow the agile framework. With a launch-and-learn mindset working to their advantage, they work on continuous integration of processes and delivery, meanwhile, publishing many open-source software. Online security firms are now using zero-trust enterprise security model from Google, instead of the traditional firewall standards. This practice has led them to let users work remotely from any location on Earth, with approved devices. With a managed hosting service working behind-the-scenes, users do not have to bother about the network level access to secure their devices. Therefore, the device’s security remains intact. Data analytics firms now work on continuous data help businesses make informed decisions. The data is first fed into a machine learning system to get better results out of it. Today, every process has become ‘continuous’. This means we can’t label any process or product as ‘completely finished’. Even the transition into this new digital world is a continuous journey. There are always updates and iterations being released by the organizations, thus testifying the process is in a continuous flow. Similarly, the security is not a fixed process, but rather it a steady flow of events, an ongoing practice that demands continuous upgrades. Also, data analytics is not just faster, but iterative. That being said, cloud computing calls for not just working faster, but working in a more efficient way. This is why cloud computing unleashes a completely new set of possibilities to think about and work within the technological environment. This fact brings us to the point that technological transition has created a strong social impact, both within the organizations and the people whom these businesses work with. Document sharing is one of the best examples of how collaborative technology works. It favors the continuous process of writing, editing, commenting, and publishing a document. Similarly, developing videos with a click of a button has strengthened the value of communication, thereby speeding up the actions.\xa0 Availability of rich data streams has transformed the way to design a prototype with an emphasis on personalization. When it comes to product development lifecycles, cloud-connected objects are having a positive impact on the whole process, thereby forcing the organizations to make frequent updates to the software they offer to the users. New versions of highly effective subscription-based model is one such example. Last year, Tesla had to improve the brakes of the cars with an over-the-air download. This is an example how cloud-connected objects influenced an alteration in the hardware system of a car. Both these examples pinpoint the fact that today, customers have become more conscious about the products they buy. This is why they want businesses to understand their wishes and pain points in advance and anticipate what they want next. This paradigm shift in the thinking of a common customer has raised the bar for competitors within the industry. Businesses like logistics and supply chain have also embraced the technological shift. Such organizations are readily accepting streaming capabilities. Blockchains have triggered a revolution in real-time payments and virtual warehousing. Similarly, Uber-like delivery services have played their part in making the payment processes continuous. Shippabo is a company that optimizes route management and compliance to make operations fast, thanks to the cloud-based infrastructure. Just a decade ago, no one could have imagined the specifications of the consoles and mobile devices that we use today. Similarly, the application of cloud in the form of the popular marketing cloud platforms, healthcare-based cloud platforms, and the emerging cloud-based educational applications are poised to change the way we work (and play) in the coming years. With this rapid growth, all major processing and computational capabilities will soon move on to the cloud and the end-users will be able to leverage this power anywhere through an on-demand consumption model. The best part? Users no longer have to invest in equipment because the cloud would take over the current endpoint hardware processing requirements. For brands, this opens up a whole new avenue of building computational and processing infrastructure that users could access through simple UI. The main challenge in this scenario is to ensure the sustained and consistent delivery of these services to a globally distributed user base and continue to provide value through new features and services. As many futurists envision, cloud computing will give rise to a whole new breed of API and microservices that would become the main service/product delivery channel for the brands. This would simplify the process of development for the end users because now they can ship releases faster without getting bogged down into code writing issues. Let’s dive into some cloud computing trends making waves in 2020. Quantum computing will transform the business world like never before. Companies like Google are leveraging the principles of quantum physics to make breakthroughs by developing next-generation products for the end users. The supercomputers are the best example of how quantum computing can work wonders if put into proper use. Corporations like IBM, Microsoft, Google, AWS are making efforts to gain competitive advantage over their competitors by adapting to the new quantum technology. Quantum computers use the principles of quantum physics to perform complex algorithm calculations and process massive datasets in quick time. These powerful computers can be used to encrypt electronic communication and help in augmenting cybersecurity. Financial institutions can use quantum computing to their advantage by making the transaction process faster. Consequently, this practice will save more time, making the process efficient. In quantum computing, data is stored in qubits, making the process much quicker, as qubits is a simpler form of data. Using quantum computing will also reduce any additional costs required to incur new resources to handle already optimized operations. Automation helps business organizations improve their productivity without spending too much time and effort. The automation tools available to us have proved to be very important when it comes to addressing errors in business processes, meanwhile streamlining them to generate fruitful results. For instance, developers can make changes to their websites hosted on the cloud before going live. If anything goes wrong, they can restore an older version of the website without affecting the sales process or user experience. As soon as the website goes live, it starts getting traffic. Opting for cloud means there will be more data consumption involved. Managing applications and routine tasks can become tedious. Developers can use automation to get rid of the manual process they have to use to carry out daily operations. Many organizations take security for granted. They simply misunderstand the concept of cloud-based security. The high-ups in the organizations think that the cloud service provider must also be responsible to provide cloud security. That’s where the misunderstanding lies. The fact remains that the security compliance is a shared responsibility of all the stakeholders involved overseeing the security operations of the organization, by proper resource usage. It is important to note that for a SaaS company the cloud service provider offers an extra layer of security along with the already built in features that come with the service package. In case of shared hosting, the user(s) must implement security measures and compliance to enhance the application of existing services and policies. We live in the world of   (IoT). With every device connected to the internet businesses now encourage use of IoT in almost every aspect of organizational operations. The IoT devices can leverage cloud computing as it offers, high speed, performance, flexibility, and ample storage space to keep the data safe, find resources, and share information among different users within the same space. There is another phenomenon – the   – an offshoot of IoT that helps us interact with each other via connected devices to a particular network. This concept is continuously evolving and it is about time when everything we use will be interconnected to an already populated network of devices. The serverless paradigm is the next revolution in waiting, according to the CTO of Amazon. The concept of serverless paradigm relates to the fact that it facilitates cloud to execute a code snippet without any hassles for the developers. Using this approach developers can divide software into chunks of code to upload on cloud to address customers’ desires, thereby delivering valuable experience. This practice ensures faster release cycle for software. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has already started using the serverless paradigm to its advantage. As cloud computing continues to make inroads in enterprise worlds, all stakeholders are looking forward to the evolution of the model. As things stand today, almost every significant innovation such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, AR/VR, robotics, and IoT rely on cloud computing technology. It’s not just computational power, networking speed, or storage capacity that makes cloud computing great. Those are just operational metrics that better technology would eventually change and replace over time. The real value of technology is what it does, not what it’s made of.\xa0\xa0 ", "Understanding cloud services and their relation to your needs can be a hassle. Many service providers offer a range of products to deploy information to the cloud, but each of those tools should fall into one specific category. \xa0Each type of product serves a different purpose and provides different tools to utilize the cloud such as development platforms or remote storage. For new businesses looking for cloud services, it's easy to see how professionals could be confused between developer jargon such as IaaS vs. PaaS. These cloud solutions are not cheap and take time to implement, so businesses shouldn't take their lack of knowledge lightly. That's okay though, G2 is here for you! If you don’t know the difference between all of the acronyms ending with “aaS”, listen up. , or infrastructure as a service, is a cloud computing model that outsources IT infrastructure through virtual hardware. Infrastructure can consist of a variety of tools such as virtualized servers, storage and bandwidth. IaaS sits at the bottom of a business's stack and allows companies to build, purchase or deploy their PaaS on top of it. IaaS solutions are often ideal for smaller businesses hoping to avoid the burdens of in-house hardware (like those with  ), which can be costly while requiring heavy maintenance. Instead, hardware is distributed through multiple data centers and managed by IaaS providers. This model is also perfect for growth companies, as these businesses can purchase extra infrastructure in the pay as you go model as needed. On the other hand  , or platform as a service, tools supply a highly scalable platform on which applications are powered. PaaS solutions provide the back-end tools for managing web applications. Hosted tools delivered through the web provide users with the tools to develop, run and manage web applications. A company's PaaS sits on top of their IaaS. Companies then release their service, software or application on top of this PaaS tool. These services often include tools such as  , web servers, operating systems and storage. Their hosted nature also allows for teams to access the platform remotely and simultaneously. : Amazon S3 and DigitalOcean. : Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure. , or mobile backend as a service, solutions are essentially PaaS solutions focused on managing mobile applications, rather than traditional web applications. These products provide computing architecture to connect mobile application to cloud storage and APIs. MBaaS solutions save development teams the lengthy process of constructing their own back-end infrastructure. MBaaS platforms provide users with tools to manage their files, host server code, connect reusable APIs, manage backend data and secure communication between endpoint users and servers. : Salesforce's Heroku and Parse. This one is a bit different from the others.  , or cloud database as a service, are simply cloud-based platforms for managing and storing data. They typically provide scalable solutions for managing and retrieving large amounts of secured data. DBaaS tools provide similar functionality to that of relational database management systems, but store data in the cloud and provide access without launching virtual machines. : Amazon RDS and Microsoft's Azure DocumentDB. The bulk of these tools function on pay-as-you-go models, giving smaller and growth companies the ability to scale as they grow without breaking the bank up front. ", "Private cloud is an essential element of a broader enterprise journey to cloud, including public and hybrid cloud.  has transformed how organizations consume, build, and deliver IT services, enabling the agility and flexibility companies need to adapt quickly to changing business conditions. Although the term “cloud” is often associated with hosted and public cloud offerings, such as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and other smaller service providers, enterprises run more of their applications   due to such issues as cost, compliance, latency, compatibility, and security. This article provides an introduction to the defining features and benefits of  , while also describing its role as the foundation of a  , which allows companies to capitalize on the advantages of both public and private clouds. A well-architected private cloud built on   can provide the agility your business needs, while maintaining the security and control IT requires. It is also the foundation of a holistic cloud strategy, one that incorporates hosted and public clouds into an intelligent and economical hybrid cloud. First, a quick primer on what “cloud” means. In the broadest sense, cloud computing refers to the delivery of IT services to users on-demand via the internet or a private network. The users consume the services without having to actively manage and maintain the IT resources. This could happen on-premises, in hosted or managed settings, and in other shared, hyperscale public datacenters. The three main categories of cloud computing services are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. IaaS provides the fundamental IT resources that end users require to deploy and run software, such as operating systems and applications. These resources include compute, storage, networks, and  , among other things. The underlying infrastructure, by design, remains largely invisible to the end user. The resources are virtualized and have varying capacities and configurations to meet the needs of the users and workloads. With PaaS, the execution environment is included on top of the infrastructure elements. PaaS enables users to deploy custom or standardized applications with supported APIs, scripts, programming languages, and tools. End users control their deployed applications and configuration settings, but the providers manage everything below this layer. SaaS is the next level up from PaaS, where end users consume the application over the network. With SaaS, a provider manages everything up to and including the application itself. Users access the services via an array of devices, such as web browsers and mobile applications. Examples of SaaS include Salesforce and Microsoft Office 365, as well as   (DaaS). More complex services such as   (DBaaS) may be considered either PaaS or SaaS, depending on how they are used. With public cloud, a third-party service provider delivers services such as infrastructure, platform, and software over the internet for use by the general public. The service providers typically own, operate, and deliver the services using their own data centers. Customers consume the services on demand, and pay only for the bandwidth, storage, and CPU cycles they consume, along with other services such as monitoring, load balancing, and data transfer. Users typically pay for increments of usage (for example, minutes, hours, or MBs), although some require an up-front commitment, such as minimum contract pricing. Public cloud offers the flexibility to quickly burst, grow, or shrink resource consumption as needed. With private cloud, an organization provisions services for a single end-user organization to consume. The end-user organization may own and operate the private cloud, or it may pay an external service provider to take on these responsibilities. Enterprises may also choose to use both approaches at the same time, as you could in an  . The infrastructure may be located on-premises within a business’ datacenter or it may be hosted off-site. Organizations often use private clouds for mission-critical workloads with specific performance, availability, or security requirements. Private clouds offer organizations the versatility of cloud computing while preserving control, efficiency, and security.  refers to the increasingly common practice of distributing enterprise workloads across multiple private clouds, public clouds, remote and branch offices, field deployments, and service providers. Organizations distribute workloads across public and private clouds for a variety of reasons, including leveraging the relative advantages of each cloud and reducing the risk of vendor lock-in. A hybrid cloud combines elements of private and public cloud. Some workloads run on-premises, while others run in a service provider or public cloud (such as GCP, AWS, or Azure) and are portable between them. Hybrid cloud aspires to seamless interoperability among the clouds, so that the management experience for administrators is essentially the same, whether the workloads are on-prem or in public cloud. At this point every enterprise has or is developing a cloud strategy. The right strategy for your enterprise depends entirely on the requirements of your business, regulatory laws, and the particularities of your applications, some of which are multitier. These characteristics shape each cloud architecture and drive the decisions about the optimal service for hosting each application tier. Public cloud serves an array of use cases, which is why companies continue to invest in this approach. However, a   found that many organizations are migrating workloads back from the public cloud to on-premises infrastructure. There are several reasons for this trend. Organizations can save money by owning rather than renting the resources to support predictable workloads--those applications that organizations use frequently, sometimes around the clock and every day. Examples of predictable workloads include ERP, databases, collaboration apps,  , infrastructure services (such as DNS, file, or Active Directory servers),  , and analytics. For workloads with elastic usage (highly variable or seasonal), it may make sense to rent the resources in the public cloud rather than purchasing on-premises resources that sit around idle most of the time, or perhaps never get used. Development and testing (known as dev/test) and reporting represent common use cases for this scenario, as they often require spinning up computing and storage resources on demand for specific tasks, and then turning them off. A key component of any cloud environment - public or private - is being able to monitor resource consumption and allocate it to business initiatives. While public clouds simply send you an overall bill at the end of the month based on your actual consumption, in a private cloud you need to consolidate upfront paid sunk costs when creating spending reports. It is not enough to account for the hardware and software licensing associated with the underlying infrastructure of a private cloud. You also need to account for the following costs associated with an on-premises datacenter:\xa0 To accurately calculate the costs of private cloud services, you need to factor in all of the above to build a true,  -based private cloud costing model. Additionally, to drive financial accountability and keep overall cloud costs under control, cloud admins need to create accurate consumption reports for individual users, teams, applications, projects, and more without having to spend a lot of manual effort to do so. Leveraging an effective tagging strategy and a TCO-based private cloud costing model is a crucial step towards creating accurate and automated chargeback reports that identify spending per cost center in a cloud. With accurate visibility and reporting into spending across public and private clouds, CIOs can better plan their future budgets and drive financial accountability into resource consumption. Organizations contract with their providers to provide certain baseline levels of service around key metrics, such as performance and availability. Because the public cloud delivers services over the internet, the physical distance and network connectivity in the last mile can cause latency issues that are unacceptable for certain mission-critical workloads.\xa0 It's important to consider availability planning for both private and public cloud options, including the potential for downtime or being unable to access resources. With private cloud, you have more control and visibility into the infrastructure, and organizations can tailor their resources to meet their exact requirements, including disaster recovery and business continuity plans. In a public cloud, security is a shared responsibility. While public clouds take ownership for securing their underlying infrastructure, the end user is responsible for securing their implementation and usage of the provider’s services and resources. A lack of clarity around this arrangement, and a lack of technical domain knowledge, lead to misconfigurations and blind spots that can ultimately leave the end user’s data and applications vulnerable to attack. This division of responsibility creates additional layers of complexity. Because the end user is free to deploy resources on-demand, it is difficult to establish and enforce a baseline security posture without additional methods for continuous security auditing and compliance enforcement.\xa0 It’s often easier to establish a stronger security posture with private clouds. Security administrators have better visibility into resources that users access and deploy as well as greater control over the configurations of the infrastructure delivering the private cloud. Moreover, private cloud enables automated enforcement through built-in network and application security policies.\xa0 Compliance has many meanings. For some organizations it's all about government or industry regulations, and for others it’s about ensuring quality, or proof that best practices are being followed. In most cases, the primary goals are around data security. For example, in the U.S., health care providers must abide by HIPAA regulations when managing personal health information, and any company that uses credit card data must follow   data security standards. One issue that can make compliance difficult is the physical location of the data. Regulations often differ among states, countries, and other political boundaries. When using public clouds, customers do not always know where their data resides. This fact can make it hard to determine which regulation applies in a geographic location and whether or not a company is violating specific regulations, such as those against storing citizens’ data beyond their nation’s borders. Noncompliance with government regulations can result in severe fines and penalties, particularly when the violation causes a breach.\xa0 Additionally, though public clouds offer alternatives for many common datacenter services, they all have their own ways of delivering those services, including different configuration options, security policies, and APIs.\xa0 Organizations lacking expertise in those differences often find it difficult to determine if their cloud services have been deployed and configured in compliance with industry best practices. It is not uncommon for security breaches to stem from basic configuration errors, such as administrators accidentally leaving their file storage service publicly accessible over the Internet. In all cases, companies must have continuous compliance auditing, as well as swift resolution of audit failures, to mitigate financial and reputational risk. Private cloud gives organizations better control over security processes as well as issues such as data residency. In general, private cloud administrators are able to address compliance issues more easily due to their familiarity with and knowledge of the entire infrastructure solution.\xa0 With the rise of cloud computing, IT is emerging as a strategic partner to the business. Many companies look to private cloud both to increase IT efficiency and to accelerate innovation. A properly designed private cloud improves IT efficiency by eliminating complexity and leveraging automation to free IT staff from mundane and repeatable tasks. IT staff typically spend the majority of their time on provisioning, updates, data protection, and troubleshooting to address operational requirements and satisfy user requests. Many of these tasks can be automated, including enabling self service for developers and internal users. Traditional IT environments are hamstrung by silos of dedicated infrastructure around crucial applications such as databases; each silo typically requires dedicated specialists. A private cloud can consolidate all of your mission-critical workloads and data into a single management interface, saving time, effort, and cost, while improving visibility into your overall environment. Greater efficiency directly supports faster innovation through removing operational friction. A properly designed private cloud helps business innovate by: Developers and application owners simply can’t do their job when it takes weeks or longer to get the resources they need to develop, run, and change their applications. Developers and testers need fast and easy access to development and test environments, with up-to-date test data, to be productive. Application owners and DBAs need access to resources to ensure SLAs and end user experience. A private cloud that enables self-service access to these resources can reduce time to market, increasing the cadence at which your company delivers new services and features. Another bottleneck with traditional IT is deployment. Users can wait weeks or more for new applications to get the IT resources they require to see the light of day. By standardizing infrastructure services and developing with those services in mind, a private cloud can support more rapid deployment and enable  . Manual tasks and workflows are the sand in the gears – or worse. It’s nearly impossible to scale application delivery without automation. A private cloud should enable automation so that IT teams can deploy, operate, and scale infrastructure and application stacks with less effort, while providing IT-as-a-Service (ITaaS) to empower development and business teams. Data is the lifeblood of an organization. The right private cloud should make data more accessible and easier to integrate, accelerating analysis and deepening insight. It also must be able to handle the different types of data and storage that the workloads require and the business demands. Having file, block, and object data under the same roof both increases efficiencies and facilitates the extraction of insights.\xa0 Only startups get a clean slate. Established enterprises often have tens or hundreds of traditional business applications that they must continue to support, even as they make new investments in cloud native applications. Most enterprises need a private cloud that can flexibly support both models. Not all innovation projects are destined to succeed. Failure is a part of innovation. A private cloud makes it easier to resource new development and application projects quickly. Fruitful ideas grow and add resources by scaling out; unsuccessful ideas release their resources and make room for the next effort. In sum, private cloud increases IT efficiency thanks to simpler operations and greater uptime. It accelerates innovation by providing developers, testers, and app owners with fast access to resources, while clearing the path for new applications to get released. It lowers complexity, which not only reduces IT costs, it also decreases risk of downtime. A successful private cloud deployment is by no means assured. It must be properly designed. Many existing private clouds suffer from one or more of the following challenges: Your private cloud may need to adapt to a variety of application needs from traditional enterprise applications to cloud native applications. Inflexible hardware and infrastructure software can make that difficult. Enterprise environments typically have a need for a private cloud with block and file storage services, in addition to the object storage common in the public cloud. Meeting those needs may require deploying and managing different hardware for each data service, adding cost and complexity. Separate storage pools decrease overall capacity utilization and limit flexibility. With data playing such a critical role in digital transformation, the importance of addressing this challenge shouldn’t be overlooked. A private cloud with an inflexible architecture and complex data services inevitably makes automation harder. As a result, it is more time consuming to create automations, automation failures are more likely, and troubleshooting and maintenance is more complex. Moreover, automation tools that are fully integrated into the platform add another layer of complexity.\xa0 In a private cloud environment, you may have less visibility of the performance requirements of each workload, and workloads can also change more quickly as users start and stop VMs and applications. As a result, some workloads can become “noisy neighbors,” taking more than their share of resources and negatively impacting the performance of others. Badly architected private clouds can also introduce single points of failure, bottlenecks, and other flaws that undermine availability. In a busy and growing private cloud environment, it can be difficult to predict when you’ll run out of performance, especially I/O performance. With multiple types of storage needed, scaling can be disruptive and expensive. The right architecture should simplify scaling; the right tools should simplify monitoring resource consumption while facilitating capacity planning and scenario testing. The more of these challenges and deficiencies your private cloud is burdened with, the more complex the environment is to manage and the more expensive it becomes in terms of both   and OpEx. If you’re going to get the return (and the transformation) you are looking for from private cloud, the following features are all required, rather than simply “nice to have”: A private cloud requires a core infrastructure that enables the advantages of the cloud itself. The complexity of traditional, aka 3-Tier, or server-SAN, IT infrastructure can end up stripping away these advantages. The   (HCI) solution provides the essential virtues of cloud computing, including self-healing, simplified capacity planning, easier automation, and reduced management overhead. There are a number of compelling use cases for choosing public cloud, such as SaaS, development and test, disaster recovery, and data protection. Fortunately the technology has finally arrived that allows you to get the best of both public and private approaches. Hybrid cloud offers the advantages of cloud computing, with the added flexibility of placing your applications and data in the optimal environment. However, it’s vital that you start with a private cloud that will allow you to build a true hybrid cloud. The ideal private cloud solution includes tools that simplify and unify management of the private and public cloud components of your hybrid cloud environment, including: application and lifecycle management, security governance, and cost governance.\xa0 The right private cloud solution should actively facilitate integration with the public cloud. This includes tools for copying, replicating, or migrating VMs and data from one location to another, support for different hypervisors, and the ability to support both VMs and containers. One of the biggest challenges for any hybrid cloud deployment is that your private cloud and public cloud(s) may have completely different management environments. This makes deployment and ongoing management more difficult and increases the potential for operator errors, security vulnerabilities, and cost overruns. It can be difficult to size equivalent VMs and storage across environments or map functionality in your private cloud to equivalent functionality in a public cloud. Make sure that the private cloud you build is an on-ramp rather than an obstacle to leveraging the flexibility and agility of a hybrid cloud. This article has talked about the many advantages that organizations can get from deploying a private cloud powered by a next-generation  . However, even more important than the technology itself is having a deep understanding of your requirements. Be sure you know exactly what problems you are trying to solve. Technology can’t fix people and process problems. Once you have done a thorough analysis, you will be positioned to build the optimal private cloud for both your immediate business and technical needs, as well as your journey to hybrid cloud.\xa0 "], 32: ['A well-executed interview can transform a podcast into something far more than two people talking into a microphone. An interview is one of the most common techniques in the podcasting world, and it’s not hard to understand why. Including interviews in your podcast can bring a new perspective to a well-trodden issue, tell a unique and collaborative story, and teach something new to the listener and host alike. However, despite its ubiquitousness as a tool for podcasters the world over, interviewing is a skill. Attempting one without the necessary knowledge or preparation could lead to a stilted and painful experience that could hinder rather than help your show. Interviews have been used in a myriad of ways for varied purposes over the years. Whether done in the halls of academia or the circles of popular culture, interviews have always existed to serve one core purpose: to tease out fresh insight into a particular subject. A great interview draws listeners into the orbit of the rapport between the host and guest. For the listener, this provides a unique experience with an expert they could never otherwise have. It situates the topic at hand in the context of the interview guest’s work and life, helping the audience understand it on a much more personal level and ultimately influence the way they see the world. So, how do you bottle this magic? Before you can get started bringing the wonders of interviewing to your podcast, you first have to figure out how to wrangle someone onto your show in the first place. Booking a guest can seem intimidating if it’s not something you’ve done before. Despite this, getting an interview set up for your podcast is easier than you might think. If you’ve already had some success with hosting interviews on your show, the first thing you should do is leverage your existing network by asking for referrals from past guests you particularly liked. Chances are, they’ll have someone in mind that you’ll love talking with and will meet all your criteria for an appropriate guest! If you’re just starting out or haven’t hosted an interview before, you’ll probably need to send cold emails. Luckily, most experts will jump at the opportunity to express their ideas for a new audience. Just make sure you explain who you are, what your podcast is, and why you want to interview them. The next part of setting up a successful interview is making sure the guest you book is the right one for your show. The most important factor for you to consider when searching for a guest is that you are personally curious about who this person is and what they’ve done. If you have an authentic interest in a particular person, even if they aren’t the most famous or successful figure in a given field, you’ll have an easier time having an engaging conversation with them. Plus, it’s never bad to provide a platform to another member of a field you’re passionate about and diversify the voices on a particular subject. If you’ve read my piece on  , you’ll know that understanding your audience is crucial for all content creators; double for podcasters who often target niche groups and communities with their shows. Similar to when you’re ideating for a new series or show segment, the audience is the ultimate arbiter of success for your podcast and should be one of the first things you take into consideration. While your interest in a potential guest is crucial for the actual execution of the interview, you also need to consider if the person aligns with the wants and needs your audience is looking for you to fulfill when they open an episode of your show. Ideally, a great guest will bring something to the table that your audience wasn’t even aware they wanted to know! It’s going to be immediately apparent if you didn’t do your homework on your guests. You want to make sure you’ve researched your guest extensively in order to get a sense of their background. Doing so will help you highlight particular aspects of their experience and expertise that will be of the most interest to you and your listeners. You also want to use this research to prepare a few questions to get the interview rolling. However, don’t rely too heavily on these to carry you through the entire interview. Almost worse than an unprepared interviewer is one that stifles the conversation by adhering to a rigid structure they decided on before their hapless guest had even spoken a single word. It’s important to let the conversation play out once the initial questions have been asked. Often, the best stories from an interviewee come from giving their thoughts space to breathe. This might feel counterintuitive. After all, you’re both there for a very specific purpose. It can be tempting to seize the reins of the conversation and steer the discussion towards that goal. Become comfortable with waiting for your guest to break the natural lulls that occur in the ebbs and flows of any organic dialogue. This will often result in them revealing something surprising and valuable that no amount of probing would have unveiled. Your role as an interviewer is to help create the space for your guest do just that. Instead of questions that ask them what you think they should talk about, inquire about the insight they’ve already given you. Ask them to expand on something that caught your interest, or pose a question about their emotional reaction to a particular event or experience. In short, make it about them. With all that said, it’s apparent that a good interview could take quite some time to execute. You need to keep your audience engaged during the period beyond the simple utility of providing information. You want to draw this impulse from your listeners; make sure the questions you ask and the topics you steer the interview towards are subjects that can’t be closed with simple, canned responses. Stories are at the core of how humans communicate with one another. Not only do they help us make sense of the world around us, but they can also grip our attention for hours on end, suspending reality while we engage with the characters and emotions. We’re hard-wired to look for stories, and it’s rare to find someone who can resist a good one. It can sometimes be downright impossible to meet with an interviewee. Timing, travel costs, and a host of other factors can easily keep you and your interview guest physically separated when you actually go to record your podcast interview. Luckily, there are a variety of good software options available for hosting and recording an interview via video chat. Skype is completely free and can be used in tandem with a program called “Call Recorder” on Mac or “Pamela” on PC to record your calls. Regardless of the software, make sure you have everything in working order before you hit record. There’s no worse feeling then conducting a great interview and not having it save properly! While the only surefire way to become better at interviewing is to practice, there are a few things you can do to make sure you’re learning as much as you can from each experience. Feedback is a crucial element to improving in any endeavor. When you’re learning a new skill, there’s a lot of fumbling around in the dark that can be illuminated by honest, critical advice. It’s very easy to pick up bad habits unconsciously, and until someone points them out to you, chances are you’ll never notice. Solicit feedback early and often to make sure that doesn’t happen to you. Absorbing techniques, styles, and common questioning tactics from more experienced interviewers are a quick way to improve your own skills. Every interview hosted by veterans is an opportunity for you to understand a little more about what makes a solid interview tick. However, it’s important to make sure you develop your own style and don’t just emulate someone else. This one is by far the most involved and time-consuming. When doing this, it’s important you write out what you hear from the recording verbatim. While I was getting my bachelors in Sociology, I had to do this for a research seminar. While it was grueling to write out every stammer and false start from myself or my participant, it served to immerse me in the responses I received and the techniques I used to solicit them. You might even be surprised at how useful having a full transcription of some of your interviews can be! Making a good interview isn’t easy, but the investment is more than worth it. The value it can add to a podcast is second to none, and it can be the basis for meaningful personal and professional relationships in any field of interest. ', "All podcasts need a good home. There’s a lot more to   than simply recording your show and posting it on the internet. How and where you house your podcast can have a huge impact on the platforms you reach, the audience you’re exposed to, and the feedback you receive. Podcast hosting services are by far the most popular places for podcasters to house their content on the internet. While there are several different websites you can choose from, they are all geared towards handling the technical aspects of podcasting so that you’re free to focus on making great shows. This guide is aimed to give you an overview of what a podcast hosting service can provide for your content, along with a rundown of five of the most popular services currently on the market. If you want to make your own website to complement these offerings, check out our guide on  ! A podcast hosting service is a home for your series on the web. They provide an easy organizational method for you to structure your shows into an overall series, as well as giving your listeners a place to find the entire catalog of your content. These websites also generate an RSS feed for your podcast, which you can use to share your show to various platforms by submitting it to directors such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Stitcher. They also offer a myriad of other opportunities to help you grow and improve your podcast. It’s common to find services that have a comprehensive analytics suite to help you track your podcast’s performance, learn more about your audience, and strategize how to build a larger listener base. Most websites also offer audience engagement for soliciting feedback from your fans and listeners, and even opportunities for monetization if your podcast gains enough popularity. Podcast hosting websites are specialized to provide the kinds of services that podcasters need to host a quality show that will reach their desired audience. Podcasts are comprised of audio files which are usually quite large, traditional websites might be either unable to support them or up-charge for the bandwidth required to make them available. The majority of podcast hosting services operate on a subscription model, and luckily they’re fairly reasonable at around $10-20 per month. If that expense is too much for a casual hobby or your new content marketing initiative, there are also podcast hosting services that are completely free to use. However, these services embody the old adage that “you get what you pay for.” They might strangle the upload time and bandwidth of the streaming for your shows, degrade the sound quality of your audio recording or otherwise insert unsolicited ads into your podcasts. Not all free podcast hosting websites engage in these practices, but it pays to be vigilant if this is the route you decide to take. Most also offer upgrades to “premium” paid subscriptions if you want to take full advantage of their services. While there’s a chance that none of the options listed below will be the right fit for your podcasting needs, these overviews can act as a jumping off point for your own search.\xa0 Please note these services are listed in no particular order: With over 290,000 unique podcasts hosted on their website, Podbean is one of the larger podcast hosting services available on the web. It’s easy to use and has excellent options for new podcasters; most notably an extremely easy to navigate user interface. They also have extremely reasonable pricing. You can get unlimited storage, comprehensive statistics, sharing tools, and more for just $9 a month (billed annually, the month-by-month option is $14). You can also upgrade to an “unlimited” plan for $29 a month that includes support for Vodcasts and access to more advanced tools. Plus, you get a month free when you sign up. Furthermore, they offer an iPhone and Android apps with their subscriptions that allow you to record, publish, and manage content on the go. This, coupled with monetization opportunities such as crowdfunding make it a comprehensive service for dedicated and driven podcasters. Most websites offer “unmetered” bandwidth, which means you have a set amount you can use as much as you want, but there is a cap on the maximum server speed. Podiant is unique because it offers truly unlimited storage and bandwidth, which is a huge upside for any hosting service. The tradeoff is that the basic plan comes in around $13 a month (with more advanced packages at $30 and $40 respectively) and has less of the shiny features that a service like Podbean might offer right out of the gate. That being said, they do offer special digital presence features, such as a customizable website, to help drive traffic. This podcast hosting service is notable for the excellent WordPress plug-in included with its subscription. Having a competent website is an important component of promoting your podcast, and Castos allows you to do this entirely separate of their hosting domain. The main benefit of doing this is having two web-pages for hosting, and posting reduces the overall bandwidth you need for either. Their basic plan starts at $19 a month and has unlimited storage and comparable analytics to other podcast hosting services on the web. Most podcast hosting sites charge you every time you start a new podcast. But what if you want to create multiple shows? Transistor has you covered. They allow you to create multiple podcasts, on one account, starting at $19 / month. Each podcast you host with them gets a separate dashboard, RSS feed, analytics, and website. You can also collaborate with different people because each podcast allows you to invite teammates who can also access that show's dashboard. Transistor was voted as one of the fastest podcast platforms on\xa0 .\xa0 Anchor is a bit of an odd duck in this list in that it is advertised as being a completely free offering. While you should still heed the disclaimer about free podcast hosting services I mentioned above, Anchor has proven itself to be a complete package in its own right. It has unlimited storage and no cap on the number of shows you can host, as well as options to earn income through a variety of different Anchor-provided sources. You should be aware that the analytics package it offers is quite basic and the future of the service is somewhat murky following their acquisition by Spotify in February of 2019. Despite this, any new podcaster can easily find success in hosting their shows on Achor’s website. Choosing the right podcast hosting software for your budget and ambitions is a crucial step on an already complicated podcasting journey. Make sure you’ve carefully thought about which website to use before forking over your hard-earned cash for their services. ", 'With so much content available, finding good podcasts can be more than a little daunting. And with so many different lists proclaiming they know exactly what you should listen to, there are very few tools out there to help you actually find productive or meaningful ways to spend your listening time. Curated selections do little to empower the reader to make a decision for themselves, and often miss the overall trends of podcasting. Well, I’m going to cut right to the chase: I don’t know if you’ll like these podcasts. Hell, I don’t know if many of them are even that good! Some of them I love, others I hate.

Apple has been reticent to publicly disclose how its ranking system works; most likely as an effort to dissuade podcast creators from trying to game the system and compromising the legitimacy of their platforms suggestions.

You know what earned media is and how to get it, but here are the types of earned media: Aiming your media efforts toward gaining earned media is a surefire way to improve your public relations strategy. But don’t forget to integrate both owned and paid media too. Owned media is anything online owned and created by the business, allowing for direct control. Businesses invest a lot of time on these channels because without them, there would be fewer opportunities for earned media. Owned media provides value to users rather than pushing them promotional messaging. It takes time to build the types of owned media, but once you do, you’ll have a cost-effective, versatile, and easy to control content for your audience to engage with. Establish these types of owned media for marketing success: Paid media is advertising for your brand across one or multiple channels to generate immediate, trackable results. Usually created by an advertising agency, your brand can control the messaging and the people with whom it targets. Paid media is a y good way to gain brand awareness if you’ve launched a new product or if you’re an entirely new business. When choosing what type of paid media to place your ad dollars, be sure to have a researcher determine where your audience is. Then work carefully to craft messaging that is attention-grabbing and impactful. Types of paid media include: Even though earned media is unpaid, that doesn’t mean it’s free. It takes hard work to implement earned media, along with owned media and paid media. Earned media is most important for public relations pros, owned media takes time to develop but serves as the backbone of your media strategy, and paid media is essentially advertising.\xa0 ', "The human race is wired for storytelling. There is evidence of this as far back as prehistoric times when men drew on cave walls and wrote in hieroglyphics on tombs. Humans feel the need to tell their stories and communicate with the public. The same is true for entrepreneurs or companies, though when they tell their stories for business purposes, it’s called   (PR).\xa0 While PR has existed through the ages, it became a recognized strategy and profession early this century. \xa0It garnered widespread adoption and became a standard function for businesses of all sizes around the world. The rapid growth of PR in this century can be traced to and correlated with the introduction of several technologies, specifically the internet. Each technology opened up new channels, new ways of operating, and shifted the profession and practice in ways that could not have been imagined when they were first introduced.\xa0 Public relations is, “a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics,” according to the   (PRSA).\xa0 The following is an   within the PR industry.\xa0 Early philosophers like Plato and Aristotle recognized that public opinion matters.\xa0In 469 BC, Socrates spoke publicly to engage his crowds of young thinkers in a debate. This led to philosophers known as “sophists” teaching the art of persuasive speaking to nobleman seeking public office. Many historians cite the establishment of the “Publicity Bureau,” a firm created in 1900, as the start of the modern public relations profession in the United States. It was a firm started by three former newspapermen and thought to be the  .\xa0 In the early 1900s, PR outlets consisted of print media and radio stations. To get their stories out to the public, PR firms relied on postal mail and some telephone access, though this was often slow and limited. In 1912, the post office started used airplanes to deliver mail. However, there was no overnight mail service. Telephones were becoming common in places of business and homes, but it wasn’t until 1915 that coast to coast calls were possible. Breaking news might have taken days to reach the public due to the available technology of the time.\xa0 Activists used public relations during the war to spread propaganda, then moved into the private sector in the 1920s. As a profession, PR became established first in the United States by Ivy Lee and Edward L. Bernays, then spread internationally. The Marshall Plan in 1948 helped spread the practice to Europe as American companies opened offices abroad and with them, PR departments.\xa0At this time, public relations had a direct relationship with the media, with little input from the public. The only feedback available was the occasional letter to the editor in response to a story. In 1923, with the publication of his book  , Edward L. Bernays introduced the idea of a ‘two -way-street’ of communication between a company and the public. In this relationship, public relations was expected to explain the public to the client and vise versa. This ran contrary to the popular misconception that public relations was deceptive and manipulative. A two-way approach allowed for the integration of the public’s experience and opinions with the practice of PR. While the concept was revolutionary at the time, Bernays had no idea as to how later in the century, technology would help make this two-way conversation an easy reality and one that could happen in real-time. Once public relations became a recognized practice, trade associations, PR industry publications, and guidelines for the industry began emerging. They built on the press release format that Ivy had developed. Additionally, universities started offering curriculums around public relations. In the 1950s, television became popular in homes, businesses, and institutions across the United States and United Kingdom. It became the primary medium for influencing public opinion. It had the advantage over print and radio – a live human speaking directly to the viewer. This increased engagement, as people process images faster and retain them longer. It also provided an entirely new platform for public relations firms while demanding new skill sets, which created additional opportunities for them. Not only did the PR professionals need to craft and pitch a story to the media, but they were also now responsible for helping their clients looking and sounding good during on-air interviews.\xa0 In 1980, CNN was launched. It was the first television network to broadcast 24 hours a day, where television and radio stations had typically kept hours of operation from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.\xa0 This was the beginning of a major shift in the news cycle as we knew it. It meant that news could be reported in real time, not just during the hours when a station was broadcasting. The introduction of the internet changed everything in regard to public relations. As a platform, it offered universal access to anyone who could log on to it. This made it possible to reach anyone anywhere on the planet, in many instances, for free. Building on the introduction of 24-hour news by CNN, the Internet made it so that every website, online magazine, or online news channel was now accessible 24 hours a day. It also was a great equalizer. Any of these online outlets could reach the top, irrespective of whether they were created by a professional media company or an ordinary citizen. This growth in availability and accessibility created more outlets for PR and news and it changed the speed at which news traveled. In contrast to a print publication, the internet was more akin to TV and radio in that news could be broadcast directly to the public. It also created the ability for the general public to collect, analyze, and disseminate news, information, and opinions. This became known as citizen journalism. Networks and the media were now competing with the public in some cases.\xa0 The role of public relations grew again as practitioners and agencies needed to learn about websites, online advertising, and   (SEO). The lines were beginning to blur and the industry questioned where\xa0 PR’s role ended and marketing began.\xa0 The Internet also created the ability to have instant, two-way conversations. With TV, radio, or newspapers, readers or listeners could write in or call in to the media. Their response might be published or aired at a future date. With the internet, the public could post comments on stories in real-time. This created a shift in the balance of power, as well as the role of the audience. It also created a shift in the role and responsibility of PR professionals. Their role has now morphed from crafting and pitching a story to monitoring stories around the clock and be prepared to do damage control if the public reacts adversely to a story. Social media expanded the number of channels and formats available for public relations. It also expanded the reach of the internet and the role of the individual in the PR conversation. Individuals could host blogs, YouTube channels, websites, Instagram stories, Facebook posts, Facebook live videos, and podcasts – some of which have become as popular as major networks. In other words, individuals could become the media or comment on, like, and share stories on major media platforms. Both cases helped further expand the functions and responsibilities of public relations, with the unique requirements needed for each platform. Thanks to the internet and social media, stories now have the potential to go viral very quickly. Stories can be shared from offline to online and across various social media, as technology has made it easy to click and share. Comments optional. The negative side of this for companies and their PR teams is that a story can quickly garner negative feedback and backlash, which can also go viral. Damage control can feel like trying to stop a tsunami with a few sandbags, as the speed of news and information travels rapidly.\xa0   Another way that the internet and social media have transformed PR is that journalists and media professionals, producers, and so on use them to find story ideas and identify sources (e.g. topic experts).\xa0 Smartphones with internet access have given us the ability to be reached wherever we are. People carry their phones with them everywhere, so access to the audience is instant.\xa0 Additionally, the advanced technology in smartphones, specifically the imaging and internet access, has advanced citizen journalism rapidly. The enhanced quality of the image capturing capabilities of phones continues evolving. This makes it easy to capture high-resolution photos and videos in a flash. News in this high-resolution is now being broadcast by everyday citizens as it occurs; there's no longer even a 30-second delay.\xa0 Smart PR firms and practitioners still craft and pitch stories in multiple formats on various media outlets and channels. They also find ways to invite the public to help create their stories.\xa0The latest media outlet is smart speakers. News is now being doled out in one or two minute segments called Flash Briefings on Amazon Alexa devices.\xa0 The fact that humans need to tell stories and companies want to manage their image and communications hasn’t changed. However, the how, what, and where the stories are shared continues to evolve. While print publications still exist, many are disappearing in favor of online formats. It’s hard to know what technology will appear next and what shift it will create for public relations. Only the future will tell what new format it takes.\xa0 ", "So, you’re hosting the event of the century. You’ve planned it down to every last detail, and you have all of your  , but one thing keeps crossing your mind: How will you get everyone to come? That’s where your answer lies:  You heard me. A press release. Something as simple as a document summing up the details of your event can spread your message far and wide. So, how do you write a press release for an event? That’s what we’re here to cover. In this article I’ll give you a step-by-step walkthrough on   for your event, as well as how to get the press release coverage that you want. Let’s start with a refresher of what a press release is and why writing one for your event is important. For reference, here’s the formal definition: An official statement released by organizations that reports events, changes in circumstances, or anything else ostensibly newsworthy. Great.  Press releases are meant to pique the interest of journalists and media outlets. And, if you do it right, those journalists and media outlets just might do some   for you by sharing your newsworthy message with the public. In your case, your event details. Given that, writing a press release for your event is a great promotional tool to get your word out, and fast. So, let’s jump into how to write the perfect press release to get your event covered.\xa0  (PR) people are used to reading press releases quick. So it’s important to use basic press release format in order for them to find the information they want easily and quickly. Also be sure to check out   from PR professionals to make your event even better.\xa0 When it comes down to it, all press release are similar. They have many of the same key components, but depending on what they’re for, you might include (or exclude) different elements. An event press release is used to promote a newsworthy event that a company is hosting or sponsoring; it should include all details of the celebration, fundraiser, conference, etc. that you are hosting, as well as cover what attendees will benefit from. Now let's talk about each component a little more in depth. If you want people to attend your event, you’ve got to let them know  , right? This is where your release date comes in to play. By specifying your release date, you’re telling media outlets when you want the information to go public. There are two scenarios for the timing of your press release: 1.   – In the case that the event is nearing, you'll want to distribute the press release as soon as possible to ensure the information reaches your target audience in time.\xa0  Always include FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (yes, in all caps) in the header to let media outlets know that you’re ready to publicize the information right away. 2.\xa0  – In the case that the event is set for a future date, you’ll want to wait to distribute your press release until a specific time closer to when the event is actually happening. To prevent media outlets from sharing your information too early, issue a  . To do this, specify in your release date by writing “embargoed until [date]” in the header.\xa0 You can use either type of release date in this case, but as far as press releases for events go, I’d recommend preparing your press release for immediate release around the time of your event. Embargoing press releases are usually reserved for big reveals for things like C-level hires or new product offers.  Remember, you want to give the media and your audience enough notice so they can plan accordingly. This means  wait until a few days before the event to publicize the event details. Your heading is the first thing people will see. With that being said, it better say something that stops people from scrolling right past it. If you get your heading right, it should accomplish a couple things. For starters, it should hook the reader in enough to make them want to keep reading for more. Consider something catchy and strong that will get them excited to learn more about your event.  If you’ve done keyword research (as you should have), incorporate them here. Search engine optimization (SEO) is important for all online media, especially if you want to increase the chances of your press release being seen by your targeted attendees. Next, it should include important event details, but not too many details. For example, you can add the name and theme of your event, but leave it at that. The headline should be short and to the point so that you can communicate the rest in detail throughout your press release. Your subheading should give more depth to your heading. However, you still want to be careful not to reveal too many event details here; you just want to make readers curious as to what the event entails. Treat it like a little summary. Your heading will get journalists to find your press release, but your subheading should move them to the body of your press release for the full message.  Use title case in your heading, but sentence case in your subheading. Ever heard of “ ”? Well, your dateline will include the most important (in my opinion) two of the five: the   and  of your event. Positioned at the beginning before your lead paragraph, your date and location should be in bold text, with the location spelled out in capital letters.  Your press release will most likely be in Associated Press (AP) style. So, when it comes to the location of your event, some cities are standalone, which means you don't need to specify a state afterward. Think CHICAGO or SAN FRANCISCO. Others require a state abbreviation, like SACRAMENTO, Calif. or MEMPHIS, Tenn. Here’s a   to help Now,   portion of your press release is where you reveal all the details. Your lead paragraph is the paragraph that directly follows the dateline. It should touch on the remaining three of the five W’s:  ,  , and  ? Treat this like a summary. If one reads the lead paragraph, will they have all the important details of the event? Save the detailed descriptions for the body paragraphs. The body paragraphs should be used to communicate your core message. In other words, tell people everything they need to know about your event and why they should attend. These paragraphs should be used to talk more about the event specifics. Address the audience you’re targeting, guest speakers, if any, and the benefits attendees will get from coming. By writing a press release, you’re affirming that your event is newsworthy, so make sure to tell readers everything they need to hear to believe that.  Include quotes. They’re a great way to add emotion to the press release, which is something that gets people excited about attending your event. The   follows the body of the press release and is your standard “About Us” paragraph. In your boilerplate you should include a quick background on your company, as well as things like: Your boilerplate will be used in all of your press releases, so you only have to write it once! Be sure to update it as necessary for consistency, especially if you have numbers like revenue, employee count, etc., to remain current. Be sure not to forget contact information! This is an easy step to overlook, but it’s crucial that you don’t. Include a name, title, phone number, and email address as a point of contact from your company. This way, the media can easily reach you regarding any questions or more further information. Once you’ve included all of the information above, you’re ready to sign off. Do this by ending your press release with three pound signs (###). This tells readers they’ve reached the end of your document. Now that you’ve written the press release for your event, it’s time to distribute it! Having a solid distribution plan to reach the media with your press release should be worked into your event planning. In order to maximize reach, plan ahead by determining exactly   you want to reach and   you want to reach them. Sure, you could upload your press release to newswires and hope for the best, but I wouldn’t recommend it. You’ve spent a lot of time and energy planning your event, so the last thing you want is a poor turnout. To combat this, build a list of contacts that you want to reach out to with the information. This includes news any news outlets, journalists, bloggers, and other members of the media. When it comes to building your media list, you’ll want to assess your target audience and figure out how to best reach it. To do this, research to make sure you’re targeting media outlets and journalists that frequently cover the topic you’re pitching. Simply putting together a list of unrelated media outlets won’t do you any good. With that being said, spend time to build a list of reputable, relevant outlets. It’ll increase your chances of securing the coverage you want. Now that you’ve spent a little time building a target media list, the actual outreach process will be that much easier. If you actually want the coverage from those on your list, however, you’ll have to do some outreach. Sorry to say, but a simple “Hi there, will you cover my press release please?” won’t get the job done. What will? Well let me tell you in a few easy steps: Start by writing a basic pitch; something informative, but concise. I’d recommend four-to-six sentences here. You’ll want to leave space to explain your story – if your pitch is too long, the reporter won’t give it the attention you want. What should your pitch include? Give them the who, what, when, where, and why as well as the location and time of your event, and add any other critical or newsworthy details that’ll sell them. Heads up,  , so include the message you find most important. Your pitch could be awesome, but if your subject line doesn’t get the email opened, no one will read it. Reporters are receiving dozens of pitches every single day, if not more. So give them a reason to open and read yours. Your subject line should be short, compelling, and lead with the most important part of your story. Focus on the selling point, and build your subject line around that.  DO NOT begin your subject line with “press release,” “pitch,” or “story idea.” Reporters will see right through this. So don’t even try. Now that you’ve got your pitch and subject line, personalize the email to the journalist or media outlet you’re sending it to. Avoid sending a mass email to your media list; you should spend time composing a unique email to every reporter on your list. When it comes to actually sending the email, timing is everything. Reporters need time to turnover a story, sometimes a day or sometimes a week. So be sure to send your pitch before you expect the article to run. If you don’t hear anything back after a day or two, consider sending a follow-up email – but that means one. Hounding a reporter risks hurting your professional relationship and decreases your chance of coverage. Realize that not every pitch you send will end in a story, but with a targeted list and personalized pitch, you’ll have a better chance of getting the coverage you want. Use   by creating a Facebook event page to promote your event. On the page include event details, attach your press release, and provide a link to your website to register for the event. Also consider posting your event on platforms like Meetup\xa0and Eventbrite; a great way to make sure people are seeing what it is and when it’s happening.   is free and easy, so use your resources to get the word out about your event. There you go. The last detail of your event is officially figured out. You now have everything you need to not only write the perfect press release for your event, but also how to form a distribution plan that gets the coverage you want. If you follow this format and the press release distribution plan, you’ll be on track to hosting the event of the century, just like you planned it. "], 17: ["Have you ever dreamt of your business showing up on the first page of Google? You probably have – and for a good reason. It’s no secret that acquiring a high position in SERP usually means bringing to your website tons of free and (often) highly qualified traffic. After all, who wouldn't want to pop-up in front of the eyes of potential customers googling their problems if they are able to solve it? However, with an increasingly competitive market across all industries, climbing the top positions of the Google search is harder than ever. It’s no longer just about having a website that is optimized for keywords or publishing (self-claimed) awesome content. The currency that Google is paying attention to when choosing which website should rank high comes down to one word: . They are like gold in the real world; if you have backlinks, you have the power. In this article we will explore the process of link building in-depth and teach you how to craft an  To understand   you can build links for your website, you need to understand first  link building keeps many marketers up at night. We’ll break this down and start from the basics. In SEO terms, link building is a process of acquiring quality inbound links to a given website. This process is meant to improve the search engine ranking of such a page so that it can be more easily found by the user. Backlinks pointing back to a website signals the search engine (such as Google or Bing) that this URL is a reliable source of information and, therefore, should be visible and easily accessible to people searching for a particular information. Acquiring links is a process that can either happen organically (for example people linking naturally to your content) or be carried out purposefully. The latter is what smart companies choose to do when they decide to invest into their SEO strategy to start bringing free traffic to their websites. Link building is what can help you get ahead of the competition without spending a fortune on advertising. Truth is, there are plenty of factors determining how well your website will rank in search engines. And there are two main metrics used for “predicting” SERP position of a given URL. It is a metric developed by MOZ.   roughly reflects how well the website will rank in search engines. It takes into account several factors, including backlinks, domain age etc. DA has a scale of 1-100 with a higher number predicting the higher ranking. This is a score originating at Ahrefs.   relates solely to the strength of a website's backlink profile on a scale of 1 to 100. DR indicates given link’s popularity and estimates the organic traffic the URL could attract. A word of caution here: remember that both of these third party metrics are not directly impacting your ranking. They are just estimations that tend to be highly accurate (correlation, not causation). To simplify: the higher your domain authority and domain rating, the stronger is your ranking position and the more credible your website tends to become in the eyes of Google. This, in turn, translates into free, organic traffic coming to your page. Now that you understand the basics of link building, it’s time to learn how you can actually get inbound, quality links pointing to your website. All strategies outlined work like magic for other businesses and they can also work for you. First strategy we’ll discuss is about replacing   pointing to dead websites with links to relevant content on your own site. It’s a simple, but time-consuming process that many dubbed ineffective. However, broken link building  work well if you have the right process in place. Sounds simple, right? But the question is: how do you find broken links to replace? Let's go through an actual example to demonstrate it. To speed up the process, we will use Ahrefs and its Content Explorer feature. Let’s quickly analyze Tidio and its niche: chatbots. They have a great resource on how to make a chatbot and are looking for links from authoritative websites writing about this topic. All they have to do is search for the keyword, in this case, “chatbots” to filter out websites which created a resource on this topic and have deleted it or moved to another URL. As you can see at the bottom, this about fashion and chatbots has the 404 error which means it’s either been moved or deleted. Additionally, it has three referring domains, meaning three websites linking to it in their own content. That’s an opportunity to explore. You can check which websites are linking to it and reach out to them asking to replace this link with a link to your own content. Here’s how to easily check the backlink profile of these domains to know in which articles they have linked to this broken resource. Nobody wants to have broken or dead links on their website which makes it really easy to convince someone to replace them with your own content. Yes, the process is time-consuming, but it’s also scalable and makes up for an easy win (that is if your   is top-notch). Another wildly popular strategy is   on other reputable blogs. This is a common practice especially in the marketing niche and it’s because it’s fairly simple and it works well. In fact, apart from just acquiring a valuable backlink in the author bio or content itself, the writer is also gaining more recognition while building his or her own authority. This becomes especially important in the face of Google’s EAT score which stands for expertise, authority and trust. It relates to producing content that’s relevant and useful by people who have proven expertise in a given field. To build links with guest blogging, follow this process: You can either do this manually by searching in google for: “relevant keyword” + “write for us” string. For example, if one would want to write for websites related to yoga, here’s what pops-up when typing “ ”. And so on. You can also perform similar search using Twitter advanced search or by googling “niche + blogs accepting guest posts”. Next step in your guest blogging efforts is to find emails or other types of contact details of blogs’ editors or websites’ owners. There are a few ways you can do it: Another step is to reach out to the relevant people who are in charge of guest posts. It’s called blog outreach and it’s a simple (but not easy) process. You have to write a personalized pitch that will highlight why you are a good guest writer candidate. You can either do it manually or use tools for mass outreach. The advantage of using such tools for cold outreach is that the process is much faster and scalable. However, for many reputable blogs, especially those that don’t openly state they accept guest posts, it’s important that you keep the personalization level high and give up mass outreach. Finally, it’s the time to write your article, include relevant links and submit it. Remember to attach your author bio and make sure that the links added are do-follow. Voila! You just got your new backlink. A good idea is to keep track of your guest blogging progress using Google Sheets. Here’s how it can be done: This is one of the most scalable link building strategies of all times. Taking advantage of the so-called “unlinked mentions” is both fun and super effective. Let’s explore what this is all about. If you’ve been doing marketing online for some time now, there is a chance that others have noticed. And possibly even wrote about your business or products and services. However, it could have slipped off your radar if they haven’t linked to your website. In this case, a web monitoring tool comes in handy. Using these kinds of tools can help you find the unlinked mentions of your brand or products and reach out to these websites kindly asking them to link to you. Apart from the particular mentions of your brand, you can also use this strategy to find relevant keywords’ mentions that can be turned into linked mentions to your content. For this you can use Ahrefs Alerts. By monitoring mentions of relevant keywords, you can react fast and reach out to the websites that mentioned it asking for a link to your resource. It’s time-consuming, but you’d be surprised to find out how many people are willing to link to excellent content which makes a great addition to their own piece. Link reclamation is the process of monitoring the links that you’ve lost and trying to get them back. Link building is hard as it almost always depends on the good will of the other side: an editor or a website’s owner. Building links is really more about building relationships and this is how you should think about it. You can again use an SEO tool to see what links have previously been lost. Once you identify them, the next step is to figure out why they were removed – perhaps the website got deleted or there was a content update. To reclaim your links, your best shot is to contact the person responsible for content, enquire about the situation and suggest for them to put the link back. Again, your outreach skills will be what determines your success. Lastly, a strategy that’s still relatively underappreciated is the creation and promotion of so-called “linkable assets”. This term refers to pieces of content that are valuable enough for people to want to link to them willingly.\xa0Linkable assets can include an article with statistics, an infographic with data, a free-to-use tool, or a tutorial. For example, this article about   has naturally picked up links. People started to refer to this infographic in their own content related to newsletters. Take a look at the backlink profile. The article has 16 individual domains linking to their resource, solely because it’s useful. The same is true for any other piece of content that makes up for a great addition or supporting material, such as articles with lots of gathered data like industry statistics. For example, Tidio’s article titled “11 Chatbot Statistics and Trends You Need to Know in 2019” (now, updated to 2020) was promoted via Facebook and Google ads just to get people to link to it in their content. Here are the results: Also, some of their infographics, such as the one below, have been shared and linked to on other websites. Graphics serve as means to acquire more links, as they are universal enough to be included on every blog. They also boost credibility of the content in which they are linked to – strong writers choose to back up their statements with data. Lastly, let’s break down the strategy referred to as a  . Essentially it is a cousin of another strategy used in content marketing called “content gap analysis”. The reason it is called “skyscraper” is because the technique is based on adding new value to something that already exists and is valuable. To be effective while using a skyscraper technique, you need to spend lots of time choosing the right content to improve upon, researching ways you can make it better and then contacting people asking to link to you. To get started, you should spy on the best-performing content of your competitors first. Then produce a more comprehensive piece of content (or simply updated), identify all relevant websites which are already linking to your competitors’ content and suggest to them to change the existing link to yours. A simple process, yet it takes a lot of work and determination, as you gotta master your research and outreach skills. It’s well worth it, though! Let’s quickly go over the most common terms used in the context of link-building in the SEO world. Anchor text is a single keyword or a phrase that is hyperlinked. For best SEO practices, the anchor text should be naturally looking and highly relevant to the content which it represents and links to. Backlinking is the process of acquiring quality inbound links to a website. Backlinking is used to refer the user or reader to another relevant piece of content or source that supports statements or data in the initial article. Do-follow links are a kind of link that enables Google and other search engines to follow them to the URL they lead to. It’s the type of link that carries the authority or the so-called “link-juice”. Do-follow links are what should your backlink portfolio consist of. Domain authority is the metric that measures how strong is the given domain in the eyes of Google. It’s a rough indicator of how well a given website will be ranking in SERP. Unlike DR (domain rating), the DA score takes into account a few factors, not just the backlink profile of a domain. Simply said, it’s the way in which a page passes the authority to another page. Commonly called “link juice”. It can be either passed via internal links or external (inbound) backlinks.  have the rel=”nofollow” attribute. It signifies to search engines that the hyperlink should not be impacting the ranking of the link’s target in SERP. In simplified terms: it tells crawlers to ignore this link. Referring domain is a term used for websites which link to you, thus directing their visitors to your own URL. You might have a few backlinks coming from the same referring domain (for example from different pages of this domain). The higher number of quality referring domains linking to your site, the better. There you have it: a short list of five effective link building strategies that you can use to start climbing the search engine rankings. They will work for any website if executed correctly. Acquiring links should be the top priority of any smart business that wants to start bringing free, organic traffic instead of spending a fortune on paid acquisition channels. Once you’ve mastered the art of  , it’s time to build links and let Google know that your content is top-notch. Lastly, remember to  stick to the white-hat SEO techniques and avoid buying links or getting them from link farms or PBN. ", "We live in a digitally-informed world.\xa0 Have a question? Type it into a search engine like Google and you’ll be presented with thousands, millions, and possibly billions of websites competing for your attention.\xa0 Think about that for a minute – you have   of options to choose from. The over-saturation of content has made Google’s job of connecting you, the searcher, with the most relevant highly-authoritative results possible, increasingly difficult. So, over the years Google released a series of search engine algorithm updates with the goal of solving for   intent.\xa0 All this change brings opportunity for   to be found by their ideal audience (aka their  ). That’s critical to creating successful content in today’s online environment.\xa0 Most   forget that it’s not just about creating content for the search engine. If you want your content to rank on the first page of Google, then you need to produce high-quality, comprehensive content that search engines deem authoritative   that solve for the intent of a searcher’s query. Here’s how you can avoid   and solve for both: create targeted clusters of relevant content that each cover a specific topic in-depth.\xa0 These targeted clusters are called topic clusters. They need to lead to a comprehensive page on your website, known as a pillar page. A pillar page (also known as a content pillar or power page) is a website page that covers a specific topic in-depth and is linked to a cluster of related content.\xa0 Note that this article is not a solution for your business’s  , but rather a strategy to get more traffic to your   content. With that said, let’s get started with the mechanics of a topic cluster and pillar page   framework.\xa0 The first step in utilizing this framework is identifying a broad topic that you want to be known for and build authority around. Instead of thinking about specific keywords you want to rank for, focus on terms with high monthly search volume, usually two to three words in length. Let’s say you’re a service business that offers marketing training as one of your products for purchase. Your main focus is on training people to become effective inbound marketers. With this in mind, “ ” would be a great example of a broad topic you would want to be known for and build authority around. Next, if your goal is to rank for a broad topic like “inbound marketing”, then you need to be specific as to what you’re talking about by bringing context to the equation. In this case, “inbound marketing strategy” would be a great example of bringing context to the broad topic of “inbound marketing.”\xa0 The trick to doing this effectively is finding specific terms in support of your broad topic that have enough search volume to justify the time it takes to create the content. This is because you will be creating a pillar page around this contextualized topic with the intention of getting that page to rank on the first page of Google’s search results.\xa0 Keep in mind, the higher the monthly search volume, the more difficult it will be to rank for. On that note, choosing keywords that have lower monthly search volumes can still make a big impact on your search engine visibility. You may think that 300 monthly searches for a specific keyword is low, but ranking for a keyword with this monthly search volume can pay off in the long run. That’s because the average first-page ranking will also   for about a thousand other relevant keywords.\xa0 Remember, search engines are much smarter nowadays. Their main goal is to solve for searcher intent. Yes,   is still important, but if search engines think your content solves for the intent of a search query, even if that search query doesn’t have the specific keywords you used to optimize your content, then chances are they’ll choose to rank it anyways. That’s why it’s important to think in terms of topics over keywords. \xa0 Lastly, once you determine how you intend to rank for a term that’s specific to the broad topic you’re going to write about, you’ll want to identify your topic cluster, which will be made up of relevant subtopics. A subtopic should be strong enough to be published on its own—in the form of something like a YouTube video or blog post—but when combined with other similarly-themed subtopics, it should be relevant to and support the specific topic you’re writing about. In this case, “inbound marketing workshop” and “how do you create a professional online video?” are examples of strong subtopics that provide value on their own and are semantically related to the specific topic “inbound marketing strategy.”\xa0\xa0 To complete the topic cluster, and solve for both the searcher and the search engine, connect the pillar page and subtopics together through a series of hyperlinks. By linking your cluster together you’re passing authority through to each page a part of the cluster. If one piece of content ranks well, the ranking of other related and connected pieces of content will rise through the ranks as well. Make it a best practice to naturally include a link to your pillar page in all of your subtopic content assets, even if they’re not necessarily helpful from an   such as a link in the description of a YouTube video. Solve for the human searcher first. Adding a link in the description of a YouTube video shows the viewer a relevant next step they can take to continue consuming your content. However, a link like this won’t pass   through to the page. Here is an   of how SEO works. It shows how a topic cluster can successfully guide a website visitor through the path to purchase by making a well-informed, confident decision. Picture this: You’re a marketing manager who’s coming up on your one-year work anniversary. You’re looking to make a big impression on your manager, so you ask for more responsibility. Your manager appreciates you taking the initiative and asks you to create an outline for the business’s   for the coming year.\xa0 So...how exactly will you do that? You start your research like most people—on Google. You type in the following query: “ .” This is what you find: At the top, just before the coveted number-one listing, you see that Google generated a   for content from a marketing training company called Inbound Strategy Camp. Featured snippets are selected search results that are showcased on top of Google's organic results, just below the ads section  Google chooses to feature snippets like these from various pieces of web content if it believes the content is structured in a way that solves the intent of the search query.\xa0 \xa0 Let’s assume this featured snippet piques your interest, so you click through to the page to learn more. At the top of the page, you notice there’s an embedded YouTube video instead of a stock image (which is generally what you’d find). That’s because  want to see videos from brands—that’s more than any other type of content. Additionally, adding a video to your website can increase the chance of a  . This is especially helpful if you include a video near the top of your website pages.\xa0 Why? Because if people take the time to watch your video, then it’ll reduce your page’s bounce rate. Your website's bounce rate is the percentage of people who land on one of your website pages, then leave. They don't click on anything. They just get to one of your pages, then leave quickly. Having a low bounce rate is a strong indicator to Google that people find value in your content. And if Google thinks your content provides value, then that can lead to first page rankings for the topics you want to show up for. Here’s a tip—consider embedding YouTube videos on your website (especially near the top of the page). Not only is YouTube a popular search engine (second only to Google), but YouTube videos generally rank near the top of search results—another opportunity to claim real estate on a search engine results page.\xa0 In the example shown above, you’ll see that below the video, there’s an anchor-linked table of contents that easily allows you to jump around to different sections on the page. This is important because this page has more than 3,500 words.\xa0 Why so much content on one page? The nature of search has changed. The days of   and writing a 500-word blog post optimized for a long-tail keyword in the hopes of a first-page Google result listing are over.\xa0 Today, search engines value longer-form content. In fact, SerpIQ performed a   and found that the average first-page ranking has over 2,000 words. It’s clear that search engines value long-form content.\xa0 Moving down the page, you’ll see a bullet-pointed list that gives an overview of what the reader is going to learn in the article.\xa0 Does this look familiar? You may remember this information from Google’s featured snippet that originally attracted you to this page. Including a bulleted list near the top of your page that outlines what the reader is going to learn can land you the featured snippet (above Google’s first organic listing). As you scroll down the page, you’ll notice there’s a link to a video production resource. Video marketing has been a challenge for many businesses. If you can include video as part of your inbound marketing strategy recommendation, then you know your manager will truly appreciate it. So, you click through to the page to learn more.\xa0 As you consume this page you start to get ideas in your head for the inbound plan your manager asked you to create. As you begin to think about what you’re going to do next you notice a pop-up   shows up on the page and offers you a possible solution—an on-demand workshop to apply what you’re learning to your business. Intrigued by the offer, you click on it.\xa0 Once you arrive at the page, you notice there’s another video featured at the top of the page. That’s because   say video helps them make buying decisions, and 64% of customers say that seeing a video makes them more likely to buy. You watch the video and realize that practical guidance with an on-demand workshop is exactly the support you need to put your inbound marketing strategy together. Due to an effective topic cluster inbound marketing strategy, you were able to find the resources you needed to make an informed buying decision. There’s no definitive right or wrong way to go about creating a topic cluster or pillar page. That being said, below is a list of answers to frequently asked questions I receive often.\xa0 At a minimum, link your subtopics to your pillar page. This way you’re sending traffic to the go-to source on your website. From there, you can link to specific subtopic pages. Just make sure it makes sense and provides value to the reader.\xa0 It can be either. It really depends on the structure of your website. For example, some businesses use their blog for educational content and website pages for product and service pages. Whatever structure you decide on, just make sure to stick to it.\xa0 Absolutely. Just make sure it makes sense and provides value to the reader.\xa0 Focus on quality, not quantity (this extends to all the educational content on your website). If your website has a lot of content that’s not generating positive results, then it’s that likely it’s  . You should be frequently running   on your website. Sometimes, you may even   or make an effort to update them.\xa0 There are three commonly used  : 10x content pillar page, resource pillar page, and product or service pillar page.\xa0 Creating great content is not enough. You need to prove the value of that content to Google. The way you do that is by increasing your page’s authority via inbound links. An inbound link is a link coming from another site to your own website. Inbound links help increase  . Domain authority is a prediction of how well your website will rank on search engines. The higher your domain authority, the more credible your content will appear to search engines. And if search engines think your content is credible, then it's likely you'll see an increase in rankings.\xa0 There is always some guesswork involved when it comes to inbound marketing. It’s sometimes hard to tell which strategies or targeted keywords will take your content to the top of the SERPs. However, if you follow the topic cluster and pillar page framework and use the right   tools, you’ll eventually achieve inbound marketing success. ", 'Image optimization is an important step to achieving a better ranking, no less important than SEO for content. Namely, with Google image search   on a daily basis, it is crucial to use images on your website to promote your content. Google has recently updated its image search policies, adding the “Visit [the page the image appears on]” button instead of the previous “View Image” button. Simply put, that means that  will reach the page the image appears on, which makes supporting content extremely important. In this way,  increased dramatically, enhancing rankings and visibility. Google is also working on new image recognition tools, such as Google Lens, with reverse image search, making image optimization even more important than it already is today.\xa0 Image optimization is similar to content optimization, except it doesn’t include links. The five fastest and most efficient ways to optimize your images to rank are as follows:\xa0 Let\'s dig deeper into each to get started on our image optimization journey.\xa0 Image titles are as important as blog post titles. Because of that, they should include a keyword or series of keywords and be coupled with an appropriate description and supporting content. If you choose to use more than one keyword, separate them by hyphens and do not use stop words (prepositions, articles, and similar). The best keywords to use are location-based and long-tail keywords, especially if you run a location-dependant business.  help Google differentiate between your website and myriads of other operating within the same industry. For example, if you sell clothes, the keyword “cheap clothes” will not help your website’s ranking. On the other hand, “quality cheap clothes for teenage girls” will make all the difference.  will show your business in the selected area. An example keyword would be “quality cheap clothes for teenagers in Austin, TX.” You can narrow down the location by including different city quarters for different images for added diversity.\xa0 An image description is similar to a snippet providing insight into the offer, which is why it is of crucial importance. Every image should have proper alt and title attributes, which serve to provide context to the image. Take your time with composing descriptions. After all, they represent your offer and your brand and, as such, should be literate, concise and compelling.\xa0 The simplest reason why image sizes are important is that they affect page loading times. If we keep in mind that the majority of website visits (and any kind of interaction) take place on mobile devices, page loading times become even more increasingly important. The best choice for image formats is JPEGs, since they are small in size and don’t compromise the quality of the image. PNGs are normally used only when transparent backgrounds are needed. Last but not least, GIFs are used for small animations but only when necessary because they are limited to 256 colors. As regards image dimensions, they are not to exceed the average desktop screen resolutions, up to 2,560 pixels in width in the majority of cases. Note that images automatically adjust to the screen size, which means they will not be displayed as intended if their dimensions exceed the average desktop screen resolution. Image compression is a popular strategy for people aiming to step up the loading time of their websites. However, note that using   or   to reduce pixels is not the way to do it. Why? Because the compressed image will retain the original file size even though a smaller version will be displayed. For that reason,   is a far better option. Among the most popular solutions are Smush, GIMP and TinyPNG, but they are by no means the only tools available. Finally, uploading the same images in different dimensions and using the <img srcset=""> attribute (or a related plug-in) are a good way to get your page to display different image formats depending on the resolution of the visitor’s device. When it comes to content, everyone knows that quality SEO-optimized articles are the key to a better ranking and increased visibility of a website. Equally important is to  of your brand and maintain communication with customers by coupling different strategies to promote your content.\xa0 As explained above, images attract new customers. It is, therefore, only natural that they will look for expanded information on the product or service. In plain words, that means that the page displaying the target image should expand on the image description. For example, if the image shows a product, supporting content should explain the product in more detail. A   (CTA) is also highly recommended, since you’ll want the visitor to know how to easily perform the desired action. For that reason, it is important to not randomly place images on the website. You’d be surprised to learn how many people do just that, thinking that image search will do the job for them. SEO is an ongoing effort, with the rules of the game being changed occasionally thanks to Google algorithm updates. Just as you track the performance of the content, image performance should also be kept in mind. You can do this in the Google Search Console with the steps below. The search results show various insights, such as are pages, impressions, devices, queries, clicks, CTRs and countries. However, Google Search Console does not show file names of the images. Rather, it displays the pages where the images are featured. Simply put, that means that the tool does not differentiate between different images on the same page, but it will hopefully change soon. Everything considered, it is fair to say that image optimization is way less complicated than content optimization, so there is no reason why it should be neglected. Seeing as image search is on the rise (especially applicable to people looking for online shops), it is recommended to brainstorm each page and couple quality content with high quality optimized images.\xa0 This strategy will, over time, make your brand stand out from the competition, increase its visibility and credibility, and attract more customers by the minute. What more can one hope for?\xa0 '], 33: ["In the animal kingdom, the strongest rise to the top. It’s a fact of life, and it’s how the common English phrase “pecking order” originated. Pecking order originally described the way chickens assert dominance over each other, eventually creating a hierarchy of chickens. Now, we use it to describe a hierarchy of anything, from people to finance strategies. In corporate finance, pecking order theory is used to help explain how companies decide where to source their financing, and thus it helps explain what drives optimal  , or the ideal balance of debt and equity financing. Internal financing is the first choice in pecking order theory because there is no extra cost associated with using it. If a company uses only   for financing, there is no cost of debt or cost of equity to be accounted for. Debt financing comes in second because of the interest payments associated with using  . Whether the company decides to take out business loans or issue corporate bonds, they will have to pay some interest, making the cost of debt more than the non-existent cost of using retained earnings. Equity financing is last in pecking order theory because it is the most expensive financing option. The cost of  —for example, stock shares—is higher than the cost of debt financing. Issuing shares can indicate that a company’s management believes the shares are overvalued—a signal to investors that they might be in trouble and their share price might be about to drop. This is a case of asymmetric information, the core idea behind the pecking order theory. Let me explain. While you can explain pecking order theory in terms of how much each type of financing costs, to truly understand it, you must understand how asymmetric information causes the differences in cost. Retained earnings are the least asymmetric (or most symmetric) form of financing—there is not much room for differing information between a company and itself, so there is no risk involved in using those internal finances. External financing comes next—first debt financing, then equity financing. Debt investors don’t know everything that’s going on behind the scenes, but they can be fairly sure they’ll be paid back. Thus, they are at less of a risk than equity investors (remember, issuing additional equity gives a bad impression as it makes company stock look overvalued). Investors expect a higher rate of return based on more asymmetrical information. Less information means a higher risk, and when the risk is higher, the expectation is that the payoff is higher as well. Imagine you are a company manager in charge of deciding how to finance an exciting new project. You’ve calculated the costs, and you’re going to need $15,000 to put this idea into action. If you have $15,000 in retained earnings, you can finance this project using only internal financing. Congrats! You don’t need to seek out any external financing. Let’s say you don’t have quite enough retained earnings to cut it for this project. Your next move according to pecking order theory would be to seek out debt financing. If you borrowed the $15,000 from a bank with an interest rate of 5%, you would end up paying $750 in interest, or $15,750 total. Obviously, this is less ideal than simply paying $15,000 out of your internal finances. If you’ve been following this article, you know what’s coming next. Equity financing. As a company manager, you might conclude that debt financing is not ideal because you can’t be sure your company will be able to pay back the money it borrowed. Better to catch that kind of thing beforehand—you wouldn’t want to go bankrupt! To get that $15,000 you need using equity financing, you’d need to sell some shares. If your company’s share price is $30, you’d need to sell 500 shares in order to gain $15,000 in debt capital. However, this will dilute your share price by, let's say, $2 per share, making each share worth $28. That means you’re really giving up an extra $2 per share (or $1,000 total) when you sold those 500 shares. You would get the $15,000 right away but end up paying $16,000 total when factoring in the cost of equity. Hopefully this article helped you gain some insight into the reasoning behind different types of financing. If you are in a situation where you can’t decide how to finance your business based on pecking order theory,   can help you make a calculated choice. ", "Depending on where they live, convertible owners keep the tops of their cars covered for most of the colder months. When the conditions are right, the retractable top comes down and a cruise down the highway becomes a completely different experience. The same thing happens when convertible bondholders decide to convert their bonds into stock, but instead of waiting for a warm, sunny day, they must wait for good conditions in the stock market. Convertible bonds are a type of  , but they differ in that investors have the option to convert them into  . As a hybrid security (a financial asset that has characteristics of both bonds and stock), convertible bonds start as a way for a company to generate   in the short term. In the long term, convertible bonds may fit into a company’s capital structure as either debt financing or shareholder equity, depending on the bondholder’s action. If a convertible bond is  converted, it earns fixed interest payments on a set schedule until its maturity date. At this date, the principal amount, or the amount originally borrowed from the investor, is paid back by the company — just like a regular bond. However, if the investor decides to convert the bond into stock, they get a previously-agreed upon number of shares in return for their bond, and the company converts some of its debt into shareholder equity. While that might seem complicated, both companies and investors benefit from the flexibility that comes with convertible bonds. In addition to their flexibility, there are other incentives for issuing and purchasing convertible bonds, and some things both companies and investors should be wary of before jumping into this kind of financing. Companies are able to get away with paying a lower coupon rate (periodic payment rate) on convertible bonds, meaning that the interest payments are lower than that of most corporate bonds. However, since the bondholders may convert their bonds into shares (company equity), the value of the company’s shares may go down due to dilution — the more stocks they have outstanding, the less each stock is worth. Convertible bonds are especially appealing for young companies and startups, who can issue them even before an IPO (initial public offering after which stocks in the company can be purchased), giving them quick debt capital. Once these young companies grow and go public (or their stock appreciates), investors can convert and the company debt disappears. Investors will make less money off convertible bonds’ coupon rate, but they have an opportunity to convert their bonds into stock once it appreciates, often earning more in the long run. Remember that each convertible bond has an agreed-upon amount of shares it can be converted into. Smart investors will wait until the price of company stock rises to the point in which those shares are worth more than the principal value, or initial price paid for the bond, then convert and cash in. Let's say a car company issues convertible bonds at $1000 each with a coupon rate of 2%. Each bond can be converted into 10 shares in the company (which, as of the bond issuance date, are worth $50 each). If held like a regular bond, investors would earn $20 (2 percent of $1000) each year until the bond’s maturity date, at which investors would be paid back the $1000 principal amount. At this point, investors would not benefit from converting their bonds into shares, as the $1000 they put down towards the bond investment would convert into 10 shares valued at $50 each. That’s only half of the value (a $500 value) of the principal amount of the bond ($1000). Several years later, the company stock has appreciated and is now worth $150 per share. This would be a good time for convertible bondholders to convert their bonds and cash in on the stock market. The 10 shares, now valued at $1,500 ($150 x 10) would be given to investors in exchange for each bond. The shares are now worth more than the principal amount they invested on the convertible bonds, allowing them to profit immediately by selling the shares. Convertible bonds are not the kind of asset you can invest in, sit back, and watch earn interest. Companies and bondholders must keep a finger on the pulse of the stock market and company finances in order to be successful investors, and   can help them stay in the right lane.\xa0 ", 'Dealing in corporate bonds isn’t always smooth sailing, but corporations have means to provide investors with a life jacket in the form of a sinking fund. In personal finance, a sinking fund (or a reserved fund) is a budget category set up to fund a planned future purchase. This could be anything from a new drum kit to a trip to Mexico. In corporate finance, companies use sinking funds to pay off  . A sinking fund is a fund that a company makes periodic payments to in order to pay off  . The fund could be in the form of preferred stock, cash, or other bonds, but the money will always\xa0go toward fulfilling the par value of the bond at its maturity date. In order to set up a sinking fund, a company must first create a custodial account, managed by a trustee. It will use this account to periodically set money aside toward paying off its debts. When it comes to bonds, a sinking fund provision will be written into the small print of the\xa0bond itself. Typically, this provision states that the bond issuer promises to pay back a certain amount into the sinking fund annually, and when these payments will begin. Sinking funds put companies at an advantage in that they improve their creditworthiness, allowing them to pay investors at a lower interest rate. A company with bond sinking funds is more appealing to lend money to because there is less default risk, or chance that it will not be able to pay off investors. Sinking funds can make a company more trustworthy and their bonds more secure. On the flip side, sinking funds may also disadvantage companies that could make better use of that money elsewhere. Putting money into sinking funds means it can’t be used to fund growth, making company stock less appealing to investors. As was mentioned above, sinking funds lower bonds’ default risk. This is a benefit for lenders–they can be assured that the company is putting money toward paying off their investment. The value of the bond may also go up, giving the lender the option to sell the bond at a price higher than par value, or the original amount they paid. There is a risk, however, that they may have to sell their bond back to the company before its maturity date, therefore ceasing to gain interest. This comes into play when a call feature is written into the sinking fund provision. The call feature allows the company to buy back a certain amount of the bonds it has issued at random, using a lottery system to choose random bond serial numbers to identify which ones to buy back. Unlucky investors whose bonds are chosen through this system must sell their bonds back to the company at either par value or the current market price, whichever is lower. Even if your vessel is in ship shape, there’s always a risk of something going amiss. Sinking funds make investing in bonds more of a safe bet, however, much like a ship setting sail, no matter the precautions you’ve taken there’s always a chance of a storm in the skies or a hidden iceberg in the deep. Companies must carefully consider whether to include sinking fund provisions in their bonds, and investors must consider whether bonds with sinking funds are right for them.\xa0 '], 48: ['Rule follower or rule breaker, abiding by the terms of your legal agreements should be a high priority for your business.\xa0 Ideally, when a business contract is formed, both parties would hold up their end of the deal, both sides would reap the agreed upon benefits, and no disputes would arise. However, we do not live in a perfect world, and   can be hindered by a variety of problems.\xa0 Business issues present themselves even when efforts are made to avoid them. Unexpected events occur, processes cause delays, and financial situations can get messy. If one of the countless potential business issues you can run into keeps you or a party you have a contract with from fulfilling their obligations, that is known as a breach of contract. When someone breaches a contract, they have to pay damages to the aggrieved party since they were negatively affected. Contracts will typically include a course of action to follow if either party breaches the contract, but the nature of the breach will typically determine the remedy following it. Contracts will typically outline what constitutes a breach for that particular agreement, but to officially determine if a one has occurred, a judge will examine it. After answering all of those qualifying questions, the judge will determine whether or not a breach of contract occurred. If it didn’t, the contract will continue until its expiration, termination, or renewal. If a breach of contract did occur, then the appropriate remedies will be rewarded to the affected party. While breaching a contract will likely look different depending on the subject matter of the agreement, there are three categories of action that encapsulate all methods of breaching a contract: The first method listed above is what is known as an actual breach of contract, because the breach actually happened. The other two listed are known as renunciatory breaches or anticipatory breaches. In both of those situations, the breaching\xa0 party will renunciate the contract before they are supposed to have performed their obligations.\xa0\xa0 These ways of breaching a contract only define how the contract is breached. The severity of the breach is a completely different story. The way or method or breaching a contract is simply the action a party took, or didn’t take, that resulted in them not fulfilling their obligations in the agreement.The   of the breach refers to the seriousness of the offense.\xa0 Each term within a contract is classified as either a warranty, condition, or innominate term. So each classification is a breach of one of those terms of the contract, giving us the three types: breach of warranty, breach of condition, or breach of innominate term.\xa0 A warranty is an assurance by one party that a particular statement is true and reliable. Essentially, it’s a promise that whatever good is being sold is in the exact condition that the seller has described. Warranties typically accompany any agreement made regarding the sale of real estate, insurance, or products.\xa0 A breach of warranty occurs when the seller of a product fails to fulfill the terms of a promise made regarding the quality or type of product. When describing a product in advertisements or sales promotions, misrepresentation might occur in regards to the safety and security of using a product. If someone buys that product and can prove that they relied on those false promises of safety, the contract can’t be terminated, but they can claim damages from the seller on the basis of breach of warranty.\xa0 The next classification is a breach of condition. The conditions of a contract get right down to the actual transaction of the agreement. Conditions can be explicitly stated or implied. Even if a condition is implied and not expressly stated, they are required to be present when entering the contract.\xa0 A\xa0 breach of condition occurs when one of the above conditions is not fulfilled by one of the contract’s parties. If someone proves breach of condition, the claimant can terminate the contract and receive damages from the other party.\xa0 An innominate term falls between a warranty and a condition. The seriousness of a breach of innominate terms varies, giving it a wide range of consequences. In the case of breach of innominate term, the court (or whichever style of conflict resolution the parties choose) will decide the impact on the innocent party.\xa0 If it’s determined that the breach was serious enough that it ruined the entire value of the contract for the aggrieved party, they will likely be allowed to end the contract. If the term that was breached was minor, the aggrieved party will likely only be allowed to sue for damages but not terminate the contract. Another measurement of the seriousness of a contract breach is whether it was material or minor. Whatever category the court places the breach in will determine the legal remedies for the aggrieved party.\xa0 A minor breach occurs when a party fails to perform a small detail of the contract. In this case, the entire contract has not been violated and can still\xa0 be performed in a certain manner. Minor breaches can occur when there is a small technical error in the wording of the contract. Terms written incorrectly like the wrong date or price can cause a minor breach.\xa0 A material breach, also known as a fundamental breach, occurs when the breach is so substantial that it basically cancels the contract because it makes performance on the behalf of both parties impossible or if one party doesn’t receive their agreed upon benefit. When a material breach occurs, the nonbreaching party no longer has to perform their duties and has a right to all remedies.\xa0 Here’s a quick example to make a distinction between minor and material breaches.\xa0 Say Mike agreed to deliver 100 oranges to Bob’s Orange Juice Stand by Tuesday. If the delivery arrives on Tuesday but instead of oranges, 100 apples are delivered, this would be seen as a  . If a delivery of 100 oranges arrived a day late on Wednesday, this would be seen as a   (unless it was explicitly stated in the contract that deadlines are firm).\xa0 When a contract is breached, there is going to be a breaching party and a nonbreaching party. The course of action for both groups is going to look different.\xa0 If you are the breaching party, there’s a chance you can fix your mistake before it affects the other party. If that’s possible, take whatever action is necessary to right your wrong. Whatever the case may be, reread the section of the contract that discusses what to do in the event of the breach. The contract might specify a certain period of time the breaching party has to fix their mistake or how to handle the situation altogether.\xa0 If the breach can’t be fixed, the breaching party should alert the nonbreaching party and tell them what happened to show good faith. The parties might be able to find a way to resolve the breach on their own. As a last resort, the breaching party should find another way to fulfill their obligations.\xa0 If you are the nonbreaching party, you have an automatic right to file a lawsuit against the breaching party. However, litigation is a pain, and it’s definitely favorable to find a way to resolve the issue on your own. Your first step should also be to reread the contract. Take note of any clauses with information\xa0 regarding damages or the amount of time the breaching party has to fix the breach. It’s in the best interest of the nonbreaching party to give the breaching party a chance to resolve the situation. If nothing can be done to reverse the breach, it’s possible that there is an alternative solution that can\xa0 still fulfill the nonbreaching party’s needs.\xa0 However, they are under no legal obligation to accept a remedy that doesn’t completely resolve the breach, fulfill the initial promise, or compensate the suffered damages. If this is the case, the nonbreaching party can file a lawsuit. If you are the nonbreaching party and you’ve decided that there’s no way for the breaching party to fulfill their obligations after the breach occurred, you might decide to sue the other party. Before filing the lawsuit, make sure the contract doesn’t have any clauses regarding whether or not a lawsuit can even be brought. It’s possible that the agreement specifies that another contract dispute resolution method is required, such as mediation or arbitration.\xa0 After the breach of contract is proved, the aggrieved party will file a breach of contract claim with the appropriate court and follow that specific course of action.\xa0 Not all breach of contract scenarios will require legal assistance from a lawyer. For example, if you decide to resolve the situation with an alternative conflict resolution method like mediation or arbitration, you won’t need a lawyer. This is good news for both parties, as it will save plenty of time, money, and energy.\xa0 The deciding factor of whether or not you should take the breach of contract claim to court all lies in the severity of the subject matter and potential damage. If you are dealing with a breach of a business contract or an agreement that deals with something of great value, you’ll likely want to seek help from a  . Lawyers are professionals in drafting, reviewing, and editing contracts to prepare you for negotiations, minimize risks, and avoid legal disputes.\xa0 When a party breaches a contract, the aggrieved party is entitled to relief, also known as remedies. The purpose of a remedy is to put the nonbreaching party in as good of a situation if the breach had never happened. There are three types of remedies for breached contracts: damages, specific performance, and cancellation, and restitution.\xa0 Damages are the most common form of remedy from a breach of contract. Depending on the contract at hand, damages will fall into one of the four following categories:\xa0 Essentially, damages refer to some form of payment or another.\xa0 Sometimes, damages might not cut it for the aggrieved party. If this is the case, they might prefer specific performance, which is a court-ordered performance of a specific duty. This type of remedy is really only used for unique situations where damages aren’t going to cover the loss caused by the breach.\xa0 The nonbreaching party can also decide to cancel the contract and sue for restitution, or restoring them to their situation before the breach. Courts will typically order the breaching party pay restitution if the other party experienced some sort of financial setback because of it. And because this also includes the contract being cancelled, it relieves all parties of their associated obligations. Say someone you entered a contract with claims you’ve breached it in one way or another. This isn’t automatically game over. There are a few defenses you can raise that can get you out of legal trouble.\xa0 If you encountered any of those situations above when entering a contract and the other party claims you breached it, these defenses should hold up in court.\xa0 From all of the information included above, it’s obvious that breaching a contract will enter you into a complicated process that can result in some serious consequences. All in all, when you sign a contract, it’s in your best interest – and that of the other party – to abide by your obligations and be proactive in noticing and resolving issues. It will save you from a world of hurt later on.\xa0 ', 'Details matter. Especially in legal agreements.\xa0 Every term, condition, and individual facet of a legally binding contract can make a world of difference. Wording can make or break obligations, definitions can simplify the language or cause confusion, and missing or included elements can be the difference between a valid or void contract.\xa0\xa0 A null and void contract is an illegitimate agreement, making it unenforceable by the law. Null and void contracts are never actually executed because they are missing one or more of the required elements of a legal agreement.\xa0 Writing a contract is a lot of work, and it’s a huge bummer when you can’t follow through with the agreement because the contract is null and void. It’s crucial that your   includes methods and procedures to refrain from creating contracts that can’t be enforced because it’s missing an important element or it wasn’t properly reviewed.\xa0 To take extra precautions, you need to understand the necessary elements of a contract, what makes a contract void or voidable, how to terminate an agreement with the other party, and how to avoid useless contracts by implementing a solid review process.\xa0 Defining what makes a contract null and void first requires an explanation of the  . While the detailed contents of a contract will differ depending on the subject matter, a contract must include the following six elements to be legally binding and enforceable.\xa0 Contractual capacity refers to an individual’s ability to enter into an enforceable contract. People who are underage, mentally disabled, or intoxicated lack legal capacity and can’t be held liable for their end of the agreement. They can choose to move forward with the agreement if they wish, but they can also exit the contract at any time without breaching.\xa0 An offer is the initial draft of a contract that includes the terms of the contract to which the offeror is willing to be bound. Most offers – and contracts for that matter – include a promise to act or not act in a certain way or an exchange of promises. If the offer is accepted and signed, it becomes legally binding at that moment.\xa0 Acceptance, in reference to the offer made, is an agreement to abide by the terms and conditions in the contract provided by the offeror. An offers acceptance must be made in the manner specified by the contract, or, if not specified, in a way that is seen as reasonable for that situation. If an offer is accepted, it is approved of to its entirety. If not, the offeree can send the offeror a counter offer, which is simply a modified version of the original contract. The process then starts over with that new offer and the roles are reversed.\xa0 Legality simply refers to whether or not the terms, conditions, and overall agreement abide by the law and public policy. If the subject matter of a contract isn’t legal, it isn’t enforceable. For the agreement to be valid, the deal must be legal.\xa0 Consideration, in regard to contracts, is the exchange of one thing for another. Contract law states that both parties in the agreement need to provide something of value for the agreement to be valid. Consideration can include money, an item, or completing a certain action for someone.\xa0 Mutuality is a contract element that states both parties need to be bound to the agreement for it to be valid. If one party isn’t legally bound, then neither are. Mutuality is an issue in situations where one party has the ability to exit or cancel the contract and the other doesn’t. Those types of agreements lack mutuality and aren’t valid.\xa0 Now that we know what makes a contract valid, let’s take a look at what makes one void and voidable. While the roots of those words are the same, they have different meanings when applied to contracts.\xa0 A void contract is one that is illegitimate and unenforceable no matter what. Contracts are void because of the way they were drafted. Typically, these agreements don’t abide by the six elements of a contract listed above. A contract can also be considered void if all obligations have been fulfilled and there is no longer anything to enforce.\xa0 For example, if Tom and Mike enter a contract stating that Mike will pay Tom to rob a bank and share the profits, this contract is void and unenforceable from the start because the subject matter is illegal.\xa0 Although the name may lead you to believe differently, a voidable contract is actually a valid agreement that can be enforced if both parties decide to move forward with it. However, as the agreement moves forward, the contract can become void later on at the option of one of the parties.\xa0 The affected party can either decide to exit the contract without committing a  \xa0or continue with it if they wish. For example, if a minor signed a contract with a business, they can choose to exit the contract without penalty if they wish. Or if they want to move forward with the agreement, they can do that as well.\xa0 The key difference between a void and voidable contract is the time at which the agreement is considered void. A void contract is unenforceable from the beginning when it was created, and a voidable contract starts as valid but might become enforceable later on.\xa0 If you have entered a voidable contract and have assumed the position of the party looking to end the agreement, you have to properly terminate the contract. If you don’t, you might be held liable for breaching the contract. Or even if you are simply in a contract that you want to end early, you can also implement one of these termination methods to avoid issues later on.\xa0\xa0 It’s a long process to send or receive an offer, get to a final draft of a contract, and abide by the terms and conditions required of you. And to do all of that for the contract to be void or terminated is even worse. Here are some tips on reviewing a contract to implement so you can avoid unenforceable contracts, legal trouble, or both.\xa0 This is arguably the most important part of entering any legal agreement. Before you send or when you receive an offer, make sure you take the time to read it carefully. Don’t skip ahead to the terms and conditions, and never assume you know everything included in the contract. These documents can get lengthy and confusing, but it’s better to take more time to go over everything with a fine-tooth comb than sign something that includes details you aren’t aware of.\xa0 Whether you are writing the original contract offer or redrafting another version to send a counteroffer, it’s necessary to be as clear as possible. Contracts are not a time to play games or try to trick people. Every term, condition, description, and detail of the contract must be as clear and definitive as possible. A lot of contracts will include a section that defines any terms that could have multiple meanings or are too jargony.\xa0 When reading through the contract, you might come across some terms, clauses, or entire sections that aren’t very clear to you. If this is the case, always clarify things that don’t make sense. Again, it’s best to take more time to reach a final contract draft that everyone is comfortable with. Make sure the other party is doing this as well.\xa0 Oral contracts are valid agreements, but they can be a bit difficult to enforce. Details can be forgotten, and when it comes down to handling conflict, it’s one party’s word against the other’s. Written versions of contracts include all details of the deal and evidence that the agreement actually exists.   isn’t always necessary, but as the agreement becomes more detailed, it becomes more relevant.\xa0 No matter the deal, it’s always a good idea to get to know the other party. And the more serious and long-term the agreement, the more important this becomes. Make sure the other party is trustworthy and able to hold up their end of the bargain. While part of entering a contract is to offer someone else something of value, it can’t just be a one-way exchange.\xa0 The agreement you’ve made with someone might be simple, but things can get a bit complicated once you formalize it with a contract. It’s never a bad idea to run through your contract again to ensure you won’t encounter the possibility of it becoming void. Read it, understand it, and then read it again (just for good measure).\xa0 ', 'In simple terms, a contract is a promise.\xa0 Whether that promise is to follow through on a predetermined action, refrain from an activity, or exchange goods all depends on the agreement at hand. But at the same time, no matter the type of deal made, it’s never a bad idea to put it in writing for the sake of your  .\xa0 Not every type of agreement requires a written contract by law, and there are plenty of low-stakes promises that can be counted on with an oral agreement. However, the more complicated the agreement, the more likely you’ll want to get every little detail in a formal written contract.\xa0 Even if you trust the other party in the agreement, terms can be forgotten and loyalties trusted. If you make an oral agreement and the other party doesn’t comply, there’s not much proof that they were required to.\xa0 Play it safe. Write a contract. Here’s how to go about it. Chances are this is your first time writing a contract. It’s a big step, but it doesn’t start with sitting down with a pen and paper writing out terms and clauses. Even before you go about considering the essential elements of a contract, you need to do some preliminary thinking.\xa0 The first thing you need to do is determine if your agreement even requires a contract. Again, it’s possible that your deal can be taken care of with an oral agreement. A good rule of thumb to follow is asking yourself if something of significant value is being exchanged, such as labor or services, time, intellectual property, or material items.\xa0 Common instances that will involve a contract include buying or selling a home or car, starting a job with a new employer, or offering your services for a particular period of time (like a contract employee).\xa0 Once you’ve determined that your agreement calls for a contract, you need to make sure that you meet all the requirements to make it valid. There are a few other  you’ll have to include in the writing portion, but at this point you should be thinking about the four things that are necessary to move forward legally.\xa0 Capacity refers to a person’s ability to enter a legally binding contract. There are certain groups that can’t be held accountable for their obligations: You can still enter a contract with someone that falls under one of those categories. However, since they lack capacity, they can   at any time without breaching the contract.\xa0 Legality covers whether or not the subject matter of the contract is legal. If the agreement includes any illegal activities, the contract isn’t valid. Similar to capacity, you can technically still make a contract that contains illegal subject matters. However, if the other party doesn’t hold up their end of the deal, you have no argument that they are liable for damages in court because the contract was illegal to begin with.\xa0 Consideration is the exchange of one thing of value for another. If your agreement lacks consideration, you won’t have a reason to form a contract. Examples of valid consideration include money, services, taking a certain action, or refraining from one. Things that don’t count as real consideration are taking action voluntarily or performing existing duties.\xa0 Mutuality refers to the idea that if one party is bound to the contract, then both parties have to be. If one party can opt out of the agreement at any time and the other person lacks that ability, courts will likely rule the contract invalid.\xa0 Before you write up the official offer and expect an acceptance in return (those terms will be covered later on), make sure that all parties involved have a good idea of the agreement. Drafting up the actual contract is quite a bit of work, so ensure that everyone knows what to expect. Have a discussion with everyone involved to go over the terms and conditions so anyone can mention if something seems off or needs to be adjusted before the offer is written.\xa0 If you’ve decided the contract is necessary, gained an understanding of the requirements of a contract, and verified that all parties are in agreement, it’s time to write the actual document. It’s important to note that writing the draft might take some time, but paying attention to detail should not be sacrificed.\xa0 The first part’s easy. Start with the most basic information of the agreement, like the names of the parties included and the date of the exchange. Specify which party is the buyer and which one is the seller. If the contract is between two businesses, make sure to use their full legal names. If you want to include other identifying information like someone’s title, you can also include it here.\xa0 The opening statement might look something like this:\xa0 “This contract is between ___ and ___.” Or this: “Alex Jenkins and Ben Smith hereby agree as follows:”\xa0 Now’s the time for further elaboration. Describe what goods or services are being exchanged in clear, readable language, and in as much detail as possible. Remember that an agreement had been made in good faith earlier between the two parties, so it’s important to abide by those terms as much as possible.\xa0 State the agreement, or what one party is promising to another and vice versa. Make sure to use short and simple sentences with clear language. Courts usually rule how a contract would be interpreted by the average person, and your average person isn’t a lawyer. If some terms seem a little bit ambiguous, include a section that defines each word as it will be used throughout the entirety of the contract.\xa0 When elaborating on the exchange, make sure to use as much detail as possible. Don’t assume anyone will abide by anything that isn’t explicitly stated in the contract. If you don’t put it in writing, there are no guarantees.\xa0 Signing a contract that includes this statement on the exchange is a risk for both parties. On Alex’s side, there are no details that guarantee compensation or placement of the article. For Ben, he will have no idea when the article will be completed or if it’s of appropriate length.\xa0 In this situation, both parties know exactly what they’re getting.\xa0 If your contract includes the exchange of goods, describe the object as thoroughly as possible. Instead of saying that you’re going to sell Alex Jenkins your red car, include the make, model, year, and delivery date.\xa0 It’s possible that you would prefer that the other party keep the contents of the contract and your personal details a secret. If this is the case, you can include a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or a mutual NDA. This means that both parties would take legal action if the other revealed confidential information.\xa0 Every contract needs a method of termination. For one time exchanges, the contract will end upon completion of both parties’ requirements. If the contract is regarding an ongoing agreement, designate an end date for the contract or state how either party can terminate the contract. This is also where you will include details if someone breaches the contract, which means they don’t abide by the agreement of the contract after it’s signed. On top of that, you’ll need to lay out dispute resolution terms if that breach occurs. Make a note of things like jurisdiction of court action and payment terms.\xa0 You should’ve checked for legality of subject matter before you started writing the contract. However, once all the details are squared away, you should do another confirmation that every single aspect of the contract is legal. Research the state and federal laws that apply to the contract so you can ensure that it can be enforced on both levels.\xa0 It’s format time. If you have all of the appropriate parts of a standard contract, the order should come naturally. It’ll usually look something like this:\xa0 At this point, you probably have a copy of the contract in your hand, ready to send it over to the receiving party. While a simple signature is all it takes to officially enforce the written agreement, there is plenty more work ahead before you get there.\xa0 Before the contract can be executed, you need to send a draft of it over to the other party. This is what’s known as an  . It’s important to note that the draft of the contract at this point should reflect the agreement made in good faith earlier on, but it should also be exactly the way that you, the writer, wants it. If the recipient accepts the offer, all they have to do is sign it and it becomes legally binding. There’s no turning back for you at that point without breaching the contract.\xa0 If you want the contract to be finalized and signed by a certain time, include a date that the contract either needs to be signed or rejected. If you don’t include a deadline, the timing depends on what the court sees as a reasonable time frame for the subject matter of the contract.\xa0 After you send the contract, the recipient can either accept it or reject it. If the recipient has no changes to the contract, that is known as an   of the agreement.\xa0 However, if they come back with a modified version of the contract, it’s known as a counter offer. If the recipient sends you a counter offer, it terminates the validity of your original offer. It’s common for both parties to   about the terms of the contract before they reach a final agreement.\xa0 After you’ve reached a final agreement and both parties are happy with the current state of the contract, it’s time to make it official. To do that, both parties need to sign and date the contract.\xa0 It’s possible that your negotiations and re-drafts of the contract happened online. If this is the case, your signature will likely occur using  Signing a document online has been a concern of contract parties for some time, but an electronic signature is just as legally binding as one on pen and paper. After you sign, make sure to keep a copy for your own personal records, and insist the other party does the same.\xa0 Above everything else, remember that once the contract is signed by both parties, it becomes legally binding and enforceable by law. If you don’t follow through on your end of the exchange that is laid out in a contract that you signed, that is a breach of contract and there will likely be penalties. Sign with caution.\xa0 After you’ve signed a contract, you need to make adjustments in your daily, monthly, or yearly routine to abide by the terms you agreed to. This might look like adding a new employee to the payroll or checking one thing off your to-do list and being done with it. Whatever the promise was,   should be your number one priority after signing a contract. And the best way to do that is by implementing a contract management strategy and software.\xa0 As your small business grows and changes, the contracts will pile up. From relationships with vendors to managing employees to closing deals with customers, you’re going to have a few different varieties of legal agreements on your hands. Non-compliance is a recipe for disaster, and a guaranteed way to get into legal trouble is not having a contract management system in place.\xa0 Contract management is a strategy that governs the creation, execution, and management of all of your company’s contracts. And no, this doesn’t mean throwing all of your documents into a filing cabinet.\xa0 When the time comes, be sure to invest in some  . This tool will help your business automate the creation, tracking, and monitoring of all your contracts, no matter their subject matter. Contract management software will help you stay compliant in all of your agreements by prioritizing organization, accessibility, and awareness.\xa0 Writing a contract is a big deal. It can also be a bit time consuming. You want it to be worth your while, and more importantly, you want to do everything you can to ensure that you are getting your value from the exchange. Here are some tips for writing a tight contract that will make everyone happy.\xa0 One thing contract law loves is consistency. As you check for your contracts legality, part of that is making sure it abides by state law. If you and the other party live in different states, pick one state’s laws to apply to the contract and clearly state it in the document. This will avoid sticky situations later on.\xa0 When sending an offer to a business, quadruple check that you are speaking with the right person before you start negotiations. If you aren’t connected with the decision maker and go through all of those discussions, it might be a waste of your time. If you are connected with someone who has to run everything by their boss, kindly ask to be connected to them. When negotiating, make sure you are speaking with the person that has the authority to enter the company into a contract.\xa0 Contracts don’t have to be bursting at the seams with legalese. It can confuse people and cause problems during negotiations. To be fair and make sure all parties are as clear on the contract terms as possible, keep your wording and structure simple. Make sentences short, clear, and concise.\xa0 Legal agreements shouldn’t be taken lightly. When it comes to writing a contract for a complicated deal, it’s important to get everything in writing. However, what’s even more important is effective communication between parties regarding the agreement itself.\xa0 \xa0 ']}

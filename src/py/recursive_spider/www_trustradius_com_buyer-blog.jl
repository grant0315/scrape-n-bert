{"content": "Marketing automation platforms\u2014the swiss army knives of marketing\u2014supposedly let you do it all.\u00a0 They allow you to send out beautiful emails, coordinate social media campaigns, track customer behavior across all marketing channels, play nice with your CRM and give you all the reporting you need.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet marketers often have a love-hate relationship with their  . We hear complaints like: These pain points are very real for marketers.\u00a0 Knowing this, we took detailed information from over 6,000 reviews and 200 survey responses from marketing automation software users and put it all together in the  .\u00a0 Not only does this guide give buyers a detailed breakdown of the 7 most reviewed marketing automation tools, but it also highlights what marketers find frustrating about their platforms.\u00a0 We discuss what those marketing automation software fails are and what you can do to avoid them. Marketing automation tools are robust, but they aren\u2019t always user-friendly. Marketers often complain that their tool is difficult to use out-of-the-box, that there aren\u2019t enough training resources, and that onboarding and implementation can be a very slow process.\u00a0 To get the most out of your solution, you will likely want three things: IT folks on your team to support implementation, awesome customer support from the vendor and accessible training resources (tutorials, onboarding material, a supportive online community, and so on).\u00a0 Personalization has been a trend in marketing for a long time now. If you go on any marketing automation vendor website, you will see personalization listed as a key feature for their tool.\u00a0 And while tools do offer personalized email and dynamic content, marketers aren\u2019t always satisfied.\u00a0 When putting together our Buyer\u2019s Guide, we found that only 42% of marketers felt that their solution could do everything they wanted it to regarding personalization. The majority of users felt that their platform facilitated personalization to some degree \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t everything they needed.\u00a0 When you set out to choose a new marketing automation tool, explore what specific features the vendor offers regarding personalization.\u00a0 Consider features like AI-powered emails, dynamic content, triggered emails, segmentation, nurture campaigns and more. You may need to talk directly to a salesperson to cut through the marketing jargon.\u00a0 Artificial intelligence is gaining traction in marketing automation. This technology is enabling greater personalized content recommendations based on lead behavior, predictive lead scoring, and the development of more accurate buyer personas.\u00a0 Even though AI has the potential to create higher-performing campaigns, 32% of respondents in our research were unsure of the impact of AI on their marketing campaigns.\u00a0 Though AI isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing, it can be hard to use and impractical if you don\u2019t have the necessary support.\u00a0 AI can be very useful\u2014or it can be too complicated for users to implement. Predictive lead scoring is very sexy these days; it helps marketers see where leads are in the marketing funnel based on past conversions. This is very useful when designing drip campaigns and determining when it is time to reach out to a lead.\u00a0 The catch with predictive lead scoring is that it requires a ton of high-quality data to be accurate and worth the investment. Many companies may not have this type of data yet. Only 38% of our respondents said they would be using predictive lead scoring by 2020 and about half were unsure if they would be using this feature. Even though this is a cool feature offered by many vendors, it will only make sense for companies that have the right data in place. It would make sense that your marketing automation platform and your CRM work seamlessly together\u2014 when marketing and sales teams work together, the result is more effective lead scoring and nurturing.\u00a0 But the reality is that many solutions don\u2019t integrate with CRMs the way marketers and salespeople want them to.\u00a0 Integrations between the marketing automation solution and other tools and internal databases can also be limited.\u00a0 Not every marketing automation tool lacks necessary integrations. To avoid this frustration, it pays off to research available integrations and APIs ahead of time. It is necessary to ask vendor representatives questions about APIs, pre-built integrations and how the tool works with your CRM (or CRMs) of choice.\u00a0 Reporting and analytics are critical for building successful campaigns across digital channels. Marketers need to know where they are performing well, what content is leading to sales and how customers are behaving.\u00a0 Though marketing automation tools promise reporting capabilities, marketers consistently cite this as a sore spot.\u00a0 Often, marketing automation tools provide basic reporting capabilities. More advanced analytics, on the other hand, require additional payment. Consider what reporting capabilities you need and what you are willing to pay for them. The lack of user-friendly email, landing page, and form builders may come as a surprise. After all, these builders are the cornerstone of marketing automation tools. Yet, many marketers say that email, landing page, and form builders within their tools are not user-friendly. Some tools are stronger in UX than others. If easy builders, editors, and templates are high priorities for you, focus your research on what users have to say about this specific topic. No software solution is perfect. Vendors are constantly updating their products to make your life easier and your marketing campaigns top-notch\u2014but in the meantime, the best ways to minimize these pain points are to: Here at TrustRadius, we love geeking out on software and research, so we will leave you with some pro tips for meeting both points.\u00a0 You can filter reviews on   by different characteristics\u2014marketing role, type of industry, size of business, etc. You can also filter reviews \u2018by topic.\u2019 You can sort through topics, such as usability, implementation, online training, etc.\u00a0 The   provides helpful charts to quickly understand top marketing automation tools.

Some buyers are most interested in software that is easy to use, others emphasize the need for excellent customer support, and other buyers prioritize top-of-the-line feature sets. TrustRadius is highlighting products on our site that standout in each of attributes that matter most to buyers with the 2020 Best Of Awards. TrustRadius is recognizing the products which have earned a 2020 Best Of Award. Specifically, we are celebrating those products which have earned the Best Customer Support, Best Usability, and Best Feature Set Award for this year.\u00a0 These awards are earned by the top 3 products in each category with the highest Support rating, Usability rating, and the highest rate of reviewer satisfaction with the product\u2019s Feature Set.\u00a0 \u201cCertain attributes, such as support and usability, have a particularly strong impact on users\u2019 experiences with business technology,\u201d said Megan Headley, Vice President of Research. \u201cThe Best Of Awards highlight these attributes to help buyers identify those products with standout support experiences, ease of use, and feature sets in a given category.\u201d\u00a0 B2B software products must meet high standards to qualify to compete for each Best Of Award. They must have 10 recent ratings from within the last year to ensure that the product\u2019s score is accurate. Each product must also have an aggregate attribute rating of 8.0 or higher to compete for that attribute\u2019s Best Of Award. If necessary, the Research team at TrustRadius will break ties using a textual analysis of reviewers\u2019 feedback on the attribute in question.\u00a0 The Best Customer Support Award celebrates the products with the best customer support, according to their users, in their category. As business software grows in technical complexity, a vendor\u2019s ability to assist users with any number of problems or processes can make an immense difference in users\u2019 experience with the software.\u00a0 The Best Usability Award recognizes products with the best usability scores in their category. \u201cUsability\u201d can mean dramatically different things depending on the type of software, user base, and use case. However, the need for products to fit those requirements and meet users\u2019 expectations is universal and can make the difference between a business adopting or abandoning a purchased software. The Best Feature Set Award highlights the products in each category with the feature sets that best satisfies users\u2019 needs and meets their expectations.

{"content": "A recent survey of business professionals conducted by TrustRadius revealed the   of the decade\u2013in   and beyond. It looked at   rub so many of us the wrong way and found perceptions differ along   and  . The survey also showed differences between generations of business professionals. TrustRadius compiled the top responses from each generation of survey respondents. Here are the business buzzwords Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, Millennials, and Gen Z consider most annoying. But remember, just a handful of survey respondents were part of Gen Z \u2013 aged 22 or younger. That\u2019s because 2018-2019 saw the first members of Gen Z graduate from college into the professional arena. It\u2019s still too soon to say for certain which business buzzwords this generation will hate the most. As Gen Z continues to enter the workforce, we\u2019ll see their linguistic preferences, pet peeves,\u00a0 and other cultural differences play out. How will Gen Z change the language of business, and how will doing business change the way Gen Z uses language? Many personal and professional dynamics drive our perceptions of jargon. What can we learn from the similarities and differences between generations, when it comes to the business buzzwords they\u2019re most annoyed by?\u00a0 Both the oldest and youngest professionals cringe at business social dynamics. Baby boomers and Gen Z are on the fringes. It\u2019s more awkward for them to assimilate to \u201coffice culture.\u201d They may be less interested in \u201cteam-building,\u201d as the workplace is not the nexus of their social hub. Whether they\u2019re still close with college friends or focused on their kids, families, and retired friends, they may be less concerned about getting \u201con the same page\u201d as business colleagues. While older generations are irked by the retrospective view (\u201cat the end of the day\u201d), younger generations grumble over the relentless drive for results, no matter what cliched form the imperative arrives in (\u201cmove the needle\u201d and \u201cgrowth hacking,\u201d and \u201cgame changer\u201d).\u00a0 Jargon that feels like it\u2019s trying too hard to compel progress annoys baby boomers, too. Professionals nearing the end of their careers do not need to be reminded that time is linear. They resent the phrase \u201cmoving forward\u201d because it verges on patronizing. \u201cWhat other way would time move?\u201d one survey respondent pointed out. Baby boomers get it: change is happening, whether they like it or not. But no matter how old you are, no one likes being told to \u201cthink outside the box.\u201d And whether you see it as a threat or a promise, the nebulous buzz of the \u201ccloud\u201d hangs over us all.

SaaS backup software is technology designed to store and protect data created by SaaS products. As straightforward as this sounds, it is in fact technically complex\u2013so much so that vendors are often met with a litany of customer inquiries, many technical in nature. Below are the awards for the Best in Customer Service among SaaS Backups. Veeam was praised for their candid and unscripted responses to common inquiries. SaaS backup software has to integrate with the SaaS products to store the data they produce. One would venture that such products would have to have a high degree of usability in order to achieve this, but this is not always the case\u2013as evidenced below, however, there are some product offerings that truly shine, and as such have received the award for Best Feature Set among SaaS backup utilities.

{"content": "Research shows no matter where you work, you almost certainly hear buzzwords sometimes during your day. On average,  . More likely than not, you\u2019re hearing these cliches often, or even way too much. But it turns out, buzzwords are not distributed equally in the workforce. They\u2019re most pronounced in the mid-market. Looking at the frequency of business jargon based on the number of employees who work at an organization, smaller and larger companies aren\u2019t quite as beleaguered as mid-sized companies. 26% of respondents in this study were from small businesses, 41% were from mid-sized companies, and 32% were from enterprises. Read on for more insight into business buzzwords usage by company size. You\u2019ll find out which buzzwords small business, mid-market, and enterprise employees hate. You\u2019ll also find out more about what makes language in these workplaces different. Employees at small businesses seem to experience buzzwords the least during the workday. Still, around 1 in 5 respondents who work at a company with fifty or fewer employees said they hear business buzzwords way too much on a daily basis. Around 2 in 5 small business employees said they hear buzzwords often in a typical workday, and another 29% hear buzzwords sometimes. 8% of respondents at small businesses hear them almost never, which is a higher rate of avoiding buzzwords than other company sizes. (It\u2019s 2x the amount of employees at mid-sized companies who almost never hear buzzwords.) 2 out of 5 respondents from mid-sized companies with 51-1,000 employees said in a typical workday, they hear business buzzwords way too much. Only 4% of those at mid-sized companies have workplaces mostly free of jargon. 1 in 4 mid-sized employees hears buzzwords sometimes, and another 31% hear them often during the day.\u00a0 Mid-sized companies exhibit the highest frequency of buzzwords. If you work at a mid-sized company, you are 66% more likely to hear business buzzwords way too much, compared to employees at enterprises. At a mid-sized company, you are 90% more likely to hear business buzzwords way too much than employees at small businesses. This might be because businesses in the mid-market have grown enough to have hierarchies in place, and are too large for all employees to know each other on a personal basis. But, they\u2019re not quite big enough to formal and bureaucratic. Nor do they have as many resources as enterprises. Individual personalities still hold more sway than the corporate structure, just barely. Efficiency and scalability are key, since mid-sized companies are often pushing for further growth. In that environment, having a tried and true in-group vocabulary may be particularly useful. At the same time, it\u2019s possible that employees at mid-sized companies are more easily annoyed by business buzzwords. Perhaps they are sensitive to cookie cutter terms because they\u2019re stuck between the strong valuation of individual relationships by small businesses, and the extra benefits and security that come with working for an enterprise. This could cause their answers to be more extreme, based on their perception. Buzzwords at enterprises behave similarly to small businesses. (They skew ever so slightly higher, which isn\u2019t very surprising.) 70% of respondents who work at companies with more than a thousand employees said they hear buzzwords sometimes or often during their typical workday. Around 1 in 4 enterprise respondents said they hear buzzwords way too much. Only 6% said they almost never hear business jargon. There are cultural and generational differences, too. Even gender has an impact. Did you know that For example, did you know that men hate to be told to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d more than women do? Or that women are more frustrated by being told to \u201ctake it offline\u201d?  .\u00a0 Remember: most people are not only hearing business buzzwords regularly, but using them too. The terms we ourselves use most frequently, as well as the terms favored by our bosses and our competitors, likely affects our perception of which business buzzwords are the most objectionable. Sometimes we need to use these terms to communicate efficiently and effectively in business. But they can also cause confusion, feel condescending, or be just plain annoying. Here\u2019s the  , regardless of company size. How many of them do you use with colleagues on a regular basis?

{"content": "We\u2019ve grown a lot this year and had a great year last year. We feel like we\u2019ve really found product market fit, so we\u2019re leaning into growth. We moved to a new 45k square foot office in Boston \u2013 that\u2019s triple our old space. Our team has doubled in the last year to over 150 people. Our sales team, in particular, has grown pretty aggressively. There\u2019s been a lot of change. We\u2019ve doubled down on sales performance analytics.\u00a0If you look at\u00a0 , we are the top rated sales performance analytics product on the market. We offer over 400 reports \u2013 we think it\u2019s the deepest library out there. Our product is very configurable, but customers can still be up and running within a week with limited to no professional services. That\u2019s really unique in the industry. We are uniquely positioned for SMBs, which often have small teams with limited money to spend on BI. We are the only game in town that can scale down for a 5 person sales team. So we\u2019re in a green field opportunity there. We do have larger customers as well, but we\u2019re very much focused on the SMB whitespace in the market. Most of our new customers are moving away from spreadsheets; we\u2019re not replacing other BI or analytics tools. Typically we\u2019re replacing non-consumption of BI tools\u2014folks driving decisions off of gut instincts, or people spending countless hours building Excel reports and not getting the full answer. Irrespective of price, we have the deepest set of sales analytics out there on the market bar none. I look at our value proposition as having three components: \u2014this involves trend analysis, pipeline management, and historical data. Without having a data warehouse to snapshot your data over time, we can pull data from Salesforce (going back to the first day that you used it) and show you how your pipeline has evolved. We can drill into any cohorts to see how they\u2019ve played out. When we show that to people it\u2019s mind-blowing. These are customers who can\u2019t afford to operate a data warehouse, and even with that technology, they would have needed to wait 6-9 months before looking back at it. Typically, another challenge with snapshotting has been when users want to change intervals. If they set up a weekly snapshot, then they can\u2019t look at it on a monthly interval. We\u2019re able to let them change intervals and look at different cuts of their data, which is something they just can\u2019t do with traditional BI technology. \u2014for example, if a company is very strong in healthcare but weak in IT, we\u2019ll surface that through historical win-loss analysis. Then we\u2019ll show risk factors in the pipeline, such as when we see that they usually win deals in 60 days and there\u2019s something in the pipeline that\u2019s 8 months old. We\u2019ll highlight that in a big red box. We look at lots of risk factors that we then tie back into the Salesforce UI. Whether you\u2019re a CEO or rep level, you see these alerts. One of the big challenges in CRM and analytics has been that benefits accrue to management, but the cost of running the programs is to individual contributors. That asymmetry creates adoption problems. Our approach is to arm everyone with the same tools, with a single version of the truth. This system enables reps to reverse engineer their W2. If their OTE is $150k/year, they know their quota plan, they understand their historic win rate, and what their average sales price is, so they understand how much pipeline they need to get there. InsightSquared drives behavior to either fix the risks or add more pipeline. We envision sales reps acting as mini CEOs of their own businesses, which drives really good organizational lineup. \u2014we use predictive analytics to apply the learning from historical data and current pipeline risks to decisions moving forward. Let\u2019s say there is an opportunity worth $100k, the win rate from stage three is 50%, and the average sales cycle from stage three to win is 30 days. From that information, we can form an opinion as to whether that specific opportunity will close this month or this quarter. We then build an aggregate with all the nuances of different reps\u2019 behavior, to answer the question that\u2019s on the mind of every sales manager: \u201cWill I hit my number?\u201d We have a portfolio approach to forecasting. Early on we realized that if we give customers a black box, we run into trust issues. In general I think the market is still early in the lifecycle of predictive analytics. So we provide a portfolio with a few types of forecasts. We show quantitative predictions, by stage/sales cycle, by rep, and by industry. We show trends, like closing velocity booking per period. We also overlay with collaborative forecasting in Salesforce, to show you whether those call-outs were accurate. If there are large discrepancies, those are places to explore. If reps say they will do a million dollars this month, but the trending says they\u2019ll do half a million and the quantitative says they\u2019re only going to do a quarter million because your pipeline is light, it\u2019s a big discrepancy and teams need to have a data-informed conversation about it.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity to uplift our business community by giving them this toolkit. From a customer service perspective, we punch above our weight class. There are two key differences between InsightSquared and legacy BI tools, in terms of the way we approach customer success. One, we\u2019re not driven by professional services. So a customer might get an SOW (statement of work) from our competitors, whereas we give them proof of implementation and some early value straight away. Two, we\u2019re a full-service shop. Customers bring us questions about how to configure their Salesforce architecture. Or, they come to us and say, \u201cHere\u2019s a challenge. We just missed our quarter, can you help us understand how to use your tool better?\u201d We are their outsourced data team. We\u2019re not just a piece of technology. That full-service approach really makes a big difference. We\u2019ve designed our product, like the library, for example, to drive people towards best practices. We also have a whole set of video training from our amazing content team. We try to leverage automated technology to make customer education cost effective. We have an InsightSquared Academy; right now it\u2019s really aimed at supporting our customers, but over time it will include best practices for a broader sales team perspective.

{"content": " That\u2019s why, in honor of Independence Day in the US, we\u2019re celebrating the software that users would follow to the ends of the earth with TrustRadius\u2019 Most Revolutionary Award!\u00a0 To determine the most revolutionary software, we examined TrustRadius\u2019s collection of over 2.67 million words contained in reviews across hundreds of product categories, looking for the products with the most reviewers mentions of the word \u201crevolution\u201d or any derivative thereof.  The stars at the top of our list have really earned their stripes! The people have spoken. These progressive technology products capture the innovative spirit of revolution.\u00a0  Inspired by our list of Most Revolutionary software, we\u2019ve compiled a ten-step guide to how each of our winners helps their customers start their own successful revolutions!\u00a0 Setting a focus for your budding revolution helps people rally around what\u2019s really important. Just as the Patriots of the American Revolution were seeking freedom from \u201ctaxation without representation,\u201d Appian is helping businesses free themselves from bulky manual processes. Appian\u2019s   combines intelligent automation and business process management to deliver powerful business applications to its clients. As one Appian customer, a business analyst for an aviation company, says in his review,  It sounds like when you\u2019re able to focus on the important stuff and forget about the rest, you\u2019re free to enjoy life, liberty, and happiness at work! The 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence came from a variety of occupations, including farmers, physicians, lawyers, and merchants, yet they all worked together to envision and create a system of government to replace British Parliament. Finding the right people for the job can be hard, but Oracle HCM Cloud is there to help.\u00a0 Its complete   and integrated   suite supports the entire employee lifecycle, from hire to retire. The vendor says that benefits to organizations include: streamlining operations, aligning talent management to organizational needs and providing insights to executive teams.\u00a0 A manager at an enterprise-level health and wellness company using the suite writes in their review, \u00a0 It turns out recruiting a team that\u2019ll make it into the history books and managing them throughout their employment is way easier with the right tools.\u00a0 If you thought the Declaration of Independence was written entirely by Thomas Jefferson \u2013 you thought wrong! While Jefferson did write the first draft, he had a dream team of four other delegates helping him make edits and rewrites along the way.\u00a0 MindTouch, the next revolutionary product on our list, also aims to make things better for clients by improving the customer self-service experience. According to the vendor, MindTouch brings the customer record (CRM) and   together to better understand their experience with a given brand.\u00a0  says a 10/10 star reviewer, who uses MindTouch to keep up with his customers\u2019 information needs as they buy his company\u2019s luxury motorhomes.\u00a0 Creating a revolution (and implementing a new product) can be hard work. But with the right people helping you along the way, every day can be a (Boston Tea) Party! The Revolutionary War cost the fledgling country about $400 million \u2013 that\u2019s over $2.4 billion today! Clearly, serious resources were required to take themission from a grassroots rebellion to a full-blown revolution.\u00a0 SharpSpring\u2019s comprehensive   is one such resource that has helped businesses grow rapidly, according to TrustRadius reviewers. The platform offers features like behavior-based email marketing, dynamic forms, landing page and blog builders, social media management, universal CMS compatibility, and hundreds of application integrations to its customers, the majority of whom are small businesses.\u00a0 One reviewer, a senior digital strategist at a boutique digital marketing and branding firm, says that SharpSpring   Other reviewers praise everything from its comprehensive training and support to its robust analytics and automation tools. According to the TrustRadius community, SharpSpring is a solid resource for companies who want to grow as big and strong as the mighty white pine, one of the primary symbols of the American Revolution.\u00a0 After over two decades of growing civil unrest, the Revolutionary War lasted another seven years! But our next winner, OutSystems, helps users build enterprise-grade apps way faster than that. This solution lets users visually develop their entire application, easily integrate with existing systems, and add their  when they need it.\u00a0 For example, it helped one user launch two startups in three years. He says that he chose OutSystems because   Other reviewers like how OutSystems keeps product deployment clean and integrates with legacy systems that pre-date it. Once your revolution\u2019s roots are planted, it\u2019s time to start moving quickly to execute your grand plans. TrustRadius reviewers affirm that OutSystems can help you get there. Political pamphlets were the email blasts of the 18th century, wildly popular and widely distributed through circulating societies. Act-On\u2019s   platform can help spark the same level of fervor, offering inbound and outbound marketing tools that the vendor claims enable a tighter alignment with sales and turn your data into substance helping provoke action.\u00a0 Says an Act-On purist using the tool at their small software company,  Aspiring revolutionaries, take heed: spread your message from a powerful platform and you will be on your way to success! By the time the Declaration of Independence was adopted, there had already been several battles between colonists and British troops. In response, militias began springing up from nowhere; for example, in the spring of 1775, Connecticut recruited a quarter of its military-age men to march on British-occupied Boston, along with 10,000 other New England colonists.\u00a0 Cvent Event Management also knows how to help you draw a crowd. Their software solutions automate and simplify several aspects of event planning so customers can maximize their event\u2019s impact. The Cvent platform supports  , venue selection,  , event marketing, onsite solutions, email marketing, and attendee engagement.\u00a0 \u201c ,\u201d writes a reviewer who works as a Program & Events Specialist for a midsize nonprofit. She explains, \u201cWe started small by only purchasing with one department for a one-year trial. After great success, we have expanded to all departments.\u201d Reviewers like her also enjoy the company\u2019s proactive attitude toward adding new technologies and their budget building and intuitive website design tools. Drawing a crowd is a great sign that your movement is getting traction, and Cvent helps event planners and marketers do just that, no bottle-rockets or firework display necessary!\u00a0 Today\u2019s historians widely believe that only a third of the colonist populace was in support of seceding from England. That means each of those followers was crucial to the American Revolution\u2019s success. HubSpot, which operates as an  , helps businesses create ever-important followers with tools for email marketing, landing page creation, social media marketing, content management, reporting & analytics, search engine optimization (SEO) and more.\u00a0 A client who started with HubSpot as a \u201cnovice\u201d to all things marketing now says,  \u00a0 When loyalty means the difference between success and failure, HubSpot can help you recruit a band of true Patriots for your business. Leaders of the American Revolution recognized a need for unity and collaboration amongst the colonies. Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Join or Die woodcut, featuring a snake divided into eight pieces, became a memorable symbol of colonial unity and freedom. Today, 30,000+ companies use Airtable\u2019s   to support content pipelines, product management, event planning, user research, and more.\u00a0 One reviewer, who uses Airtable to manage a nonprofit, writes,   Users also appreciate how simple Airtable\u2019s bases are to create and customize, the accessibility of the presentations that Airtable helps them prepare for stakeholders, and the platform\u2019s mobile capabilities. Airtable empowers users to build workflows for virtually any task, showing aspiring revolutionaries that unifying your efforts under a single user-friendly interface can make your business a force to be reckoned with. When the Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4th, 1776, there was still a lot of work to be done \u2013 the darn thing hadn\u2019t even been signed yet! (That happened in August.) There was a war to be won, a government to be formalized, and a country to build. Revolutionaries needed to take a long look at their core values in order to do the hard work of forging ahead. Savvy politicians and businessmen alike know that they must understand what\u2019s going on in the present and examine the past in order to create a prosperous future. Gainsight has been called out by its reviewers for helping them also work smarter and make better plans for managing their  . Gainsight\u2019s platform offers a workflow engine, data connectors, tools to manage your data architecture, as well as a business modeler and a best practice library. The vendor promises to help its clients interpret data about their own customers and see how their actions impact their accounts. The vice president of an enterprise education management company using Gainsight says in her review,  Other reviews also mention Gainsight\u2019s timeline, which lets users track important events in a customer\u2019s lifecycle in one place, its powerful rules engine, and its customizable call to action function.\u00a0 Just like the United States has come a long way since the original Independence Day, these Revolutionary Award winners have helped customers change the face of their own businesses. These products work tirelessly to adapt to the needs of their clients. Change is the spark to revolutionizing technology and countries.\u00a0 \u00a9 Copyright 2013-2022 TrustRadius ", "url": "https://www.trustradius.com/buyer-blog/2019-most-revolutionary"}
